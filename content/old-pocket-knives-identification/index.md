Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on old pocket knives identification. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to ensure I cover everything thoroughly.

First, understanding what old pocket knives identification is and why it's important. From the search results, I see that tang stamps and maker's marks are crucial. The user mentioned Case Knives using dots and X's for dating, which is a good example. Importance would include historical value, collectibility, and authenticity checks to avoid counterfeits.

Next, the historical background. The search results mention pocket knives dating back to ancient times, with Roman and Viking examples. The development of tang stamps in the 20th century, like Case's system in 2000, shows the evolution. Also, brands like Buck and Camillus have specific dating methods, which I should include.

For types and categories, the user wants different identification methods. Tang stamps, handle materials (like bone or wood), blade styles (such as clip point or drop point), and brand-specific features (Case's dots, Buck's date codes) are key. The Case example from source [1] and Buck's date codes from [2] are relevant here.

Determining value involves factors like rarity, condition, brand reputation, and historical significance. The market trends from sources [4] and [8] mention growth in the pocket knife market, driven by collectibility and outdoor activities. Pricing data from [8] shows the market size and projected growth, which adds concrete numbers.

Authenticity checks are covered in sources [5] and [6]. Browning's model numbers and font details, along with checking for counterfeits, are important. Mentioning reference books like Goins Encyclopedia from [6] adds depth.

Market trends and pricing: The North America market is growing, with a CAGR of 5.6% as per [8]. Limited editions and collaborations are trends from [4]. Auction results from [13] give real-world examples of prices.

Where to buy/sell: Online platforms like eBay, specialized forums (All About Pocket Knives from [11]), auctions ([13]), and antique shops. Etsy and Discord are mentioned in [15], which are modern platforms.

Care and maintenance tips from [10] and [14] include gentle cleaning, rust removal with baking soda or vinegar, proper storage, and professional restoration. Highlighting the importance of avoiding harsh chemicals and using knife oil is key.

I need to structure each section with headers, use examples like Case and Buck, include market data, and cite sources properly. Make sure each section flows logically, covers all aspects, and provides actionable advice. Also, check that all citations are correctly referenced from the provided search results.
