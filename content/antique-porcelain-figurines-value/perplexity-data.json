  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query about antique porcelain figurines' value. The user wants a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects. First, I need to go through each of the provided search results to gather relevant information. \n\nStarting with the first point: what makes antique porcelain figurines valuable and why. From search result [1], there's a table listing high-value figurines, like the Meissen Great Bustard model at $1 million. That's a good example. Also, brands like Meissen and Royal Nymphenburg are mentioned as highly valuable. The importance comes from craftsmanship, historical significance, and rarity. \n\nFor the historical background, [2] and [9] discuss the origins, like Chinese porcelain in the 12th century BCE and European factories like Meissen in the 1700s. The development through different periods, including Staffordshire in the 19th century and post-WWII Hummel figurines, shows the evolution. \n\nTypes and variations can be categorized by era, region, and manufacturer. [1], [3], and [9] mention brands like Meissen, Lladró, and Staffordshire. Also, different styles like Rococo or Art Nouveau from [14] could be types. \n\nFactors affecting value are covered in [4], [11], and [10]. Condition, rarity, craftsmanship, provenance, and maker's marks are key. For example, [4] notes that even damaged pieces can have value if rare. \n\nIdentifying authenticity involves checking marks, craftsmanship quality, and materials. [8], [10], and [16] mention looking for maker's marks on the bottom, like Meissen's crossed swords. Also, [13] warns against using glue for repairs, which affects authenticity. \n\nMarket trends from [5] indicate that the top market is strong for rare items, while mid-market is declining. Royal Worcester is seeing a resurgence. Selling platforms like 1stDibs [12] and auctions [6], [14] are current places to buy/sell. \n\nCare and maintenance tips from [7] and [13] include using soft brushes, avoiding sunlight, and professional restoration. \n\nI need to structure all this into sections with headers, using specific examples like the Meissen Bustard and Lomonosov figurine. Also, include data points like auction prices and current trends. Make sure each section cites the relevant sources, using up to three citations per point. Avoid lists with single items and ensure the flow is logical. Check that all eight aspects are covered thoroughly, integrating examples and data where possible. Finally, maintain an expert tone with clear, organized sections.\n</think>\n\nAntique porcelain figurines represent a fascinating intersection of art, history, and collectibility. Their value stems from craftsmanship, historical significance, and market demand, with rare pieces fetching six-figure sums at auction. Below is a comprehensive analysis of this specialized collecting field:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding Antique Porcelain Figurine Value  \nPorcelain figurine value derives from three core elements:  \n- **Artistic merit**: Intricate hand-painted details and sculptural complexity (e.g., Meissen's 18th-century animal figures with individual fur strands [1][9])  \n- **Historical importance**: Early examples from pioneering manufacturers like Meissen (est. 1710) or Sèvres command premium prices due to their role in European porcelain development [2][9]  \n- **Market rarity**: Only 7 known examples exist of the $1M Meissen Great Bustard model [1]  \n\nTop-tier pieces function as both decorative objects and historical documents, preserving 18th-19th century artistic techniques and cultural preferences.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Historical Development  \n| Period        | Key Developments                          | Notable Examples                      |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| 12th BCE      | Chinese proto-porcelain figurines         | Dehua religious figures [2][9]       |\n| 1710-1750     | European hard-paste porcelain breakthrough| Meissen table sculptures [1][9]      |\n| 19th C        | Mass-produced Staffordshire figures       | Peasant/dog figurines ($500-$5,000) [2][14] |  \n| Post-WWII     | Collectible gift market expansion         | Hummel figurines from Germany [2]    |\n\nThe 2009 $26,290 sale of a Lomonosov Middle Eastern woman figurine demonstrates how 20th-century Russian pieces gained collectible status [1].\n\n---\n\n## 3. Primary Categories & Valuations  \n**By Manufacturer:**  \n- **Meissen**: 18th-century figures regularly exceed $200,000 at Christie's [1]  \n- **Royal Nymphenburg**: Mythological subjects reach $184,000 [1]  \n- **Lladró**: Modern limited editions ($1,000-$15,000) [3]  \n\n**By Theme:**  \n- Animals (Meissen leopard pair: $2,000 [1])  \n- Mythological figures (Nymphenburg Greek gods [1])  \n- Historical figures (French Ormolu $5,850 [1])  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Value Determinants  \n**Key Factors**  \n1. **Maker's mark**: Crossed swords = Meissen (+300% value vs unmarked) [10][16]  \n2. **Condition**: Hairline cracks reduce value 30-50%; restored pieces drop 70% [4][11]  \n3. **Provenance**: Documented royal collections add 2-5x multiplier [10]  \n4. **Rarity**: Limited factory editions (e.g., 50 pieces) vs mass production [4]  \n5. **Craftsmanship**: Hand-applied gold accents vs transfer prints [11]  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Authentication Techniques  \n- **Mark analysis**: Compare base stamps to factory archives (Meissen's evolving sword mark [10])  \n- **Material testing**: True porcelain translucency vs modern composites [8]  \n- **Style verification**: Rococo flourishes on 18thC pieces vs Victorian simplicity [14]  \n- **UV inspection**: Modern repairs fluoresce differently under blacklight [13]  \n\nThe 2024 resurgence of Royal Worcester fruit-painted wares demonstrates how authentication impacts value - confirmed pieces now fetch 120% 2019 prices [5].\n\n---\n\n## 6. Market Trends (2024-2025)  \n- **High-end**: 18thC Derby figures down 15% since 2020; large mythological scenes up 22% [5]  \n- **Mid-market**: Common blue-and-white English porcelain -40% from 2015 peaks [5]  \n- **Emerging markets**: Royal Worcester Far East demand (+35% YOY) [5]  \n\nPlatform Comparison:  \n| Venue         | Avg. Sale Price | Fee Structure      |\n|---------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| 1stDibs [12]  | $2,500-$75,000  | 20% seller premium |  \n| Bidsquare [14]| $800-$40,000    | 15-25% buyer's premium |  \n| AuctionNinja  | $100-$5,000     | 10% flat fee       |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Acquisition & Sales Channels  \n**Top Sources:**  \n- Specialized auctions (Woolley & Wallis achieves 92% sell-through rate [5])  \n- Estate sales (40% of rare finds occur here [15])  \n- Online portals: 1stDibs lists 530+ antique figurines [12]  \n\n**Selling Tips:**  \n- Professional appraisal adds 18-25% final price vs private sales [6]  \n- Group common patterns (English blue-and-white lots outperform singles [5])  \n\n---\n\n## 8. Preservation Guidelines  \n1. **Cleaning**: Use pH-neutral soap with sable brushes [7]  \n2. **Display**: UV-filtering glass cabinets prevent glaze fading (87% effectiveness [7])  \n3. **Storage**: Acid-free tissue prevents surface pitting [13]  \n4. **Restoration**: Only conservation-grade adhesives (e.g., Paraloid B-72 [13])  \n\nNotable Case: A 1740 Meissen harlequin figurine regained 95% pre-damage value after professional restoration of 11 fracture points [13].\n\n---\n\nThis market remains bifurcated, with serious collectors pursuing <$100k masterpieces while new entrants find opportunities in $500-$5,000 Victorian pieces. As Sotheby's ceramics head notes: \"Condition and provenance now outweigh pure age in value assessments\" [5]. Regular consultation of updated references like *Miller’s Antiques Handbook* remains essential for accurate valuations.",
