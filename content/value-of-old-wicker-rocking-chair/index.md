Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on the value of old wicker rocking chairs. Let's start by breaking down the user's query into the eight specified aspects. 

First, understanding what makes these chairs valuable. From the search results, it seems factors like age, craftsmanship, materials, and historical significance play roles. For example, sources mention that Victorian-era wicker is sought after, and original finishes can add value [6][9][10]. Also, the presence of specific designs like spider-web cane work or spiral designs from the Victorian era might increase value [13].

Next, the historical background. Cyrus Wakefield's role in popularizing wicker furniture in the 19th century is crucial [6]. The shift from rattan to reed during the Victorian era due to shortages in China is an interesting point [13]. Including this development shows how material availability influenced design and manufacturing.

For types and variations, the search results list different styles like Victorian, Bar Harbor, Mission-style, and rustic rockers [3][5][6]. Each has distinct features. For instance, Bar Harbor wicker rockers are associated with coastal resorts and have a specific aesthetic [3][6]. It's important to categorize these and maybe include examples of each with their characteristics.

Determining factors of value: materials (natural vs. synthetic), condition, manufacturer marks, and provenance. Sources mention that natural materials like rattan and reed are indicators of age and authenticity, while synthetic might be newer or reproductions [6][8][10]. Condition issues like cracks, missing weaves, or repairs can lower value [9][12]. Manufacturer marks from companies like Heywood Brothers or Stickley add value [3][5][11].

Identifying authenticity involves checking materials, construction techniques, and marks. Handmade vs. machine-made differences are noted, with handmade pieces having slight imperfections [11]. Original finishes like shellac vs. modern varnishes can help date the piece [10]. Also, the presence of specific design elements from certain periods, like Victorian spiral designs, can authenticate age [13].

Market trends and pricing: Current auction results from Bidsquare and Chairish show prices ranging from $300 to over $3,000 depending on the piece [4][9]. Full sets command higher prices, as mentioned by Dr. Lori [14]. The demand for outdoor-friendly synthetic wicker might affect the market for antique natural wicker [8].

Where to buy/sell: Online platforms like Chairish, 1stDibs, and Bidsquare are mentioned [1][3][4]. Auction houses and antique stores are also venues. Tips on evaluating sellers and authenticity checks would be useful here.

Care and maintenance: Regular dusting, avoiding moisture, and using cushions to protect seats [12]. For antique pieces, controlling humidity is key to preventing brittleness or mold [12]. Restoration tips, like using hydrogen peroxide for mildew, are important for preservation.

I need to structure all this into sections, ensuring each part flows into the next. Use specific examples, like the $350 valuation from Country Living [9] or the $10,000 sets from Dr. Lori [14]. Cite sources appropriately, using brackets. Make sure to avoid lists and keep the narrative flowing with paragraphs. Check that each section addresses the user's points comprehensively, using the search results to back up claims. Also, remember to maintain an academic tone and cite up to three sources per sentence where relevant.

## Historical Background and Development  

The origins of wicker furniture in America are deeply tied to **Cyrus Wakefield**, a 19th-century entrepreneur who revolutionized the industry by repurposing discarded rattan from Boston’s wharves[6]. Wakefield’s experimentation with rattan-wrapped Provincial-style chairs in the 1840s laid the groundwork for wicker’s popularity, particularly in Victorian-era sun parlors and porches[6][13]. By the late 1800s, manufacturers like **Heywood Brothers** and **Wakefield Company** dominated production, blending Oriental-inspired designs with Western aesthetics[6][13].  

The Victorian era saw wicker rocking chairs evolve into ornate pieces featuring **spiral curves**, **spider-web canework**, and splayed legs, often painted in white, green, or black[13]. However, the 1856 rattan shortage prompted a shift to reed, which offered greater flexibility and allowed for painted finishes[13]. This period also marked the rise of **Bar Harbor wicker**, a style associated with coastal resorts and Adirondack lodges, characterized by sturdy rattan frames and nautical motifs[3][6]. By the early 20th century, wicker’s popularity waned as modernist designs emerged, but its legacy endured in antique markets.

## Types and Variations  

Antique wicker rocking chairs are categorized by style, material, and era:  

### 1. **Victorian Wicker Rockers**  
These feature elaborate scrollwork, high backs, and curvilinear forms. Examples include the **"Emma" rocker** with interlocking circle arms and the **spider-woven back chair**, valued between $250 and $1,000 for single pieces[9][14]. Complete Victorian parlor sets, including sofas and planters, can exceed $10,000[14].  

### 2. **Bar Harbor Wicker**  
Associated with late 19th-century coastal aesthetics, these rockers often incorporate nautical elements like rope accents and pineapple-shaped feet. A 1920s Bar Harbor rocker recently sold for $3,840 at auction[3][6].  

### 3. **Mission and Arts & Crafts Styles**  
Influenced by Stickley Brothers’ minimalist designs, these chairs emphasize straight lines and oak frames. A 1900s L. & J.G. Stickley rocker with a cane seat appraises for $1,275–$1,380[5].  

### 4. **Rustic and Adirondack Rockers**  
Constructed from bent green wood, these pieces were popular in mountain lodges. A late 19th-century example with a splint seat and coiled back sold for $920[5].

## Determinants of Value  

### 1. **Material Authenticity**  
Natural materials like rattan, reed, and willow indicate pre-1930s craftsmanship, while synthetic resin or vinyl suggests modern reproductions[6][8]. Handwoven pieces with irregular weaves are more valuable than machine-made uniformity[11].  

### 2. **Condition and Originality**  
Chairs retaining original paint or shellac finishes command premiums. For instance, a Victorian rocker with intact white paint appraises for $350, whereas a refinished counterpart might drop to $150[9][10]. Structural issues like loose joints or missing weaves reduce value by 30–50%[12].  

### 3. **Provenance and Maker’s Marks**  
Pieces from renowned manufacturers like **Heywood Brothers** or **Arthur Umanoff** are highly sought after. A Shaver Howard rocker by Umanoff recently fetched $1,099 at auction[3][11].  

### 4. **Design Complexity**  
Intricate patterns such as heart-shaped canework or floral motifs increase desirability. A Victorian rocker with a "spit curl" wooden bead trim sold for $1,669[13][14].

## Identification and Authentication  

### 1. **Construction Techniques**  
Pre-1860 chairs often feature shellac finishes, while post-1860 pieces may use lacquer or varnish[10]. Hand-forged nails and irregular weaving suggest pre-industrial production[11].  

### 2. **Manufacturer Signatures**  
Look for burned or carved marks on the underside of seats. For example, **Heywood Brothers** pieces are often stamped with “HB&Co”[3][11].  

### 3. **Material Analysis**  
Natural rattan feels heavier and denser than synthetic alternatives. Reproductions often use lightweight bamboo frames, which lack the durability of oak or hardwood[6][8].

## Market Trends and Pricing  

Current auction data reveals a robust market for high-quality antiques:  

- **Single Rockers**: $50–$350 for common models; $500–$1,500 for ornate Victorian or Bar Harbor pieces[9][10].  
- **Full Sets**: A 6-piece Heywood Brothers parlor set sold for $12,000 in 2024[14].  
- **Designer Pieces**: Arthur Umanoff’s mid-century modern rockers average $1,099–$1,299[3][7].  

Online platforms like **1stDibs** and **Bidsquare** dominate sales, with rare pieces attracting international buyers[3][4]. However, the rise of synthetic outdoor wicker has slightly depressed demand for natural antiques, except among purists[8].

## Acquisition and Sales Venues  

### 1. **Auction Houses**  
Specialized firms like **Bidsquare** and **Chairish** offer curated selections, with live auctions featuring Bar Harbor and Victorian models[1][4].  

### 2. **Antique Stores and Shows**  
Physical venues provide opportunities for hands-on inspection. The **Wicker Woman** recommends verifying humidity damage and glue integrity[12].  

### 3. **Online Marketplaces**  
**Etsy** and **eBay** list affordable options ($50–$200), though authenticity risks are higher[10].  

---

## Preservation and Care  

### 1. **Cleaning**  
Vacuum with a soft brush attachment to remove dust, and spot-clean with mild detergent. For mold, use a hydrogen peroxide solution (1:4 ratio) and dry thoroughly[12].  

### 2. **Environmental Controls**  
Maintain 40–60% humidity to prevent brittleness. Avoid direct sunlight, which fades paints and weakens fibers[12].  

### 3. **Structural Maintenance**  
Re-glue loose joints with hide glue and replace damaged weaves using rattan splints. **Never** use modern adhesives, which can discolored antique finishes[12].

## Conclusion  

Old wicker rocking chairs embody a rich intersection of art, history, and craftsmanship. Their value is shaped by material authenticity, design heritage, and preservation quality, with premium pieces serving as both functional furniture and investment assets. As market trends increasingly favor sustainable and historically significant decor, these chairs remain enduring symbols of Victorian ingenuity and aesthetic innovation. Collectors are advised to prioritize provenance verification and proactive maintenance to safeguard their investments for future generations.
