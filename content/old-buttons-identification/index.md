Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on old buttons identification. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to ensure I cover everything thoroughly.

First, understanding what old buttons identification is and why it's important. From the search results, I see that identifying buttons involves assessing age, material, craftsmanship, and historical context. It's valuable for collectors, historians, and appraisers because buttons can offer insights into past fashion, technology, and social status. For example, the Indus Valley button mentioned in [1] and [11] shows how buttons have been used since ancient times, not just as fasteners but as ornaments.

Next, the historical background. The oldest buttons date back to the Indus Valley around 2800 BCE [1][11]. The Romans used buttons made from wood and bronze, but they fell out of favor due to damaging clothes [2]. The 13th century introduced buttonholes in Germany, leading to widespread use in Europe [2][16]. The Industrial Revolution, especially the Barry Double Automatic machine in 1895, revolutionized button production [2]. This historical progression is crucial for understanding how buttons evolved, which ties into their identification.

Types and categories of old buttons. The search results mention materials like shell, metal, glass, Bakelite, and celluloid. For example, Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles are significant [1][8]. Figural designs, hand-carved details, and specific materials like mother-of-pearl or enamel are categories to explore. The Victorian era's picture buttons and cloisonné techniques [2][8] are also important. Each type has distinct features that help in identification.

Determining value involves age, material, rarity, condition, and maker's marks. The valuation tables from [9] show how age impacts price. For instance, pre-1800 buttons can be worth $10-$30, while post-1920 vintage ones are $1-$5. Rarity, like ivory or Bakelite buttons, increases value [4][9]. Condition is key; damage like broken shanks lowers value [7][14].

Authenticating buttons requires examining materials, craftsmanship, and marks. Hand-carved buttons have slight irregularities [1], while machine-made ones show mold lines. Testing materials, like the hot water test for Bakelite [14], helps. Maker's marks from guilds or manufacturers like Barry Plumbing [2] are indicators. Case studies, like the Victorian enamel buttons selling for hundreds [5], illustrate authentication processes.

Market trends in 2025 show a surge in vintage fashion, with buttons being part of sustainable trends [10][15]. Prices vary widely; some buttons sell for over $300 [5]. Online platforms like Ruby Lane and auctions [6] are key marketplaces. The YouTube examples [5] highlight how specific keywords and rare designs drive up prices.

Where to buy/sell: auctions (Lion and Unicorn [6]), online stores (Totally Buttons [3]), flea markets, and conventions [13][14]. Proper storage in acid-free materials and gentle cleaning methods [7][8] are essential for preservation.

Care tips include avoiding harsh chemicals, using soft brushes for cleaning [7], and proper storage to prevent damage. Handling with care to preserve shanks and finishes is crucial [7][8].

I need to structure all this into sections with headers, ensuring each part flows into the next. Use specific examples from the sources, like the Barry Double Automatic machine's impact [2], and case studies from YouTube sales [5]. Cite sources properly, like [1] for handmade features and [9] for valuation tables. Avoid lists, convert info into paragraphs, and maintain an academic tone. Make sure each section addresses the user's query points comprehensively, linking historical context to modern trends and practical identification tips.

## 1. Foundations of Old Buttons Identification  

### Definition and Significance  
Old buttons identification involves analyzing physical attributes (material, design, construction) and historical context to determine age, origin, and value. Buttons older than 100 years are classified as antiques, while those from 1920–1960 fall into the vintage category[1][9]. This practice is critical for:  
- **Cultural Preservation**: Buttons reflect technological advancements, such as the 13th-century introduction of buttonholes in Germany and the 1895 Barry Double Automatic machine that standardized pearl button production[2][16].  
- **Economic Valuation**: Rare materials like ivory or Art Deco celluloid command premium prices, with Victorian enamel buttons selling for $200–$1,500[4][5][9].  
- **Historical Research**: Military buttons from the American Revolutionary War or Napoleonic campaigns provide insights into uniform regulations and metallurgical practices[12][13].
