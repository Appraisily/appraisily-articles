What are the key characteristics to look for when identifying old buttons?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying old buttons involves considering several factors, including material, design, manufacturing method, and age. Start by examining the material: are they made of metal (brass, steel, silver), glass (milk glass, pressed glass), plastic (Bakelite, celluloid), bone, shell (mother-of-pearl), or cloth? The design can offer clues; look for intricate patterns, motifs (animals, flowers, heraldic symbols), and any markings or inscriptions.\n\n*   **Manufacturing method:** Early buttons were often handmade or crafted using simple tools. Later, industrialization introduced mass production techniques. For example, shank buttons (those with a loop on the back) were often hand-sewn onto garments before machines were used to create the shank as part of the button itself.\n*   **Age:** Researching button styles prevalent during specific historical periods can help narrow down the age range. For example, \"picture buttons,\" featuring detailed scenes or portraits, were particularly popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n*   **Size and Shape:** While not definitive, unusual sizes or shapes compared to modern buttons can suggest greater age.\n*   **Common Materials by Era:**\n    *   **18th Century:** Bone, pewter, hand-painted porcelain\n    *   **19th Century:** Mother-of-pearl, glass, metal (brass, steel), jet\n    *   **Early 20th Century:** Celluloid, Bakelite, picture buttons\n\n**2. How can I tell if an old button is valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the value of an old button involves assessing its rarity, condition, aesthetic appeal, historical significance, and collector demand. Rarity is a major factor; buttons produced in limited quantities, perhaps for a specific event or garment, often command higher prices. Condition is crucial; buttons free from chips, cracks, or significant wear are more desirable.\n\n*   **Rarity:** Look for unique materials, designs, or manufacturing techniques. For example, a button made from an exotic material like scrimshaw (engraved whale bone) or depicting a famous historical figure is likely to be rarer.\n*   **Condition:** Examine the button carefully for any damage. Even small imperfections can significantly reduce value.\n*   **Historical Significance:** Buttons associated with historical events or famous individuals are highly valued. Buttons from military uniforms, political campaigns, or royal garments are sought after by collectors.\n*   **Collector Demand:** Research the current market for similar buttons using online auction sites (eBay, Etsy), antique shops, and button collecting forums. A button might be rare and in good condition, but if there's no demand, its value will be limited.\n*   **Material Value:** Buttons made of precious metals (gold, silver) inherently have material value, regardless of their historical significance.\n\n**3. What are some common materials used in antique buttons and how can I identify them?**\n\n**Answer:** Antique buttons were crafted from a diverse range of materials, each with distinctive characteristics. Understanding these materials is vital for identification.\n\n*   **Metal:** Brass, steel, silver, and gold were common. Brass buttons often have a warm, yellowish tone and may show signs of tarnishing. Steel buttons can rust. Silver buttons are often stamped with hallmarks indicating silver content.\n*   **Glass:** Milk glass (opaque white), pressed glass (molded with intricate designs), and cut glass (faceted) were popular. Hold the button up to the light to examine its clarity and internal flaws.\n*   **Plastic:** Celluloid (early plastic, flammable) and Bakelite (early plastic, hard and durable) are often found. A hot needle test (done VERY carefully and sparingly in an inconspicuous area) can help identify Bakelite by releasing a distinctive odor. Celluloid is also flammable and smells like camphor.\n*   **Bone & Ivory:** Bone buttons often have a porous texture and may show signs of age. Ivory buttons are denser and have a smoother surface. These materials often show \"cross-hatch\" patterns under magnification.\n*   **Shell (Mother-of-Pearl):** These buttons have a pearlescent sheen and are often iridescent. Look for natural variations in color and texture.\n*   **Cloth:** Fabric-covered buttons were common, often matching the garment they adorned. The fabric can provide clues to the button's age.\n*   **Jet:** A black, hard material derived from fossilized wood. Often used in mourning jewelry and buttons.\n\n**4. How can I clean old buttons without damaging them?**\n\n**Answer:** Cleaning old buttons requires caution to avoid damaging delicate materials. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. The best approach depends on the button's material.\n\n*   **General Cleaning (for most materials):** Use a soft brush (like a toothbrush) and mild soap (dish soap works well) in lukewarm water. Gently scrub the button to remove dirt and grime. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and pat dry with a soft cloth.\n*   **Metal Buttons:** Use a specialized metal polish designed for antiques, following the product instructions carefully. Avoid over-polishing, as it can remove the patina, which some collectors find desirable.\n*   **Glass Buttons:** Clean with a soft cloth and a mild glass cleaner. Avoid abrasive cleaners, which can scratch the surface.\n*   **Plastic Buttons:** Use a damp cloth and mild soap. Avoid prolonged soaking, which can damage some plastics.\n*   **Cloth Buttons:** Gently spot clean with a damp cloth and mild detergent. Avoid submerging the button in water, as this can damage the fabric.\n*   **Mother-of-Pearl Buttons:** Wipe gently with a soft, damp cloth. Avoid harsh chemicals, which can dull the luster.\n*   **Important Note:** Before cleaning an entire collection, test your cleaning method on a single, less valuable button to ensure it doesn't cause any damage.\n\n**5. Where can I buy or sell old buttons?**\n\n**Answer:** The market for old buttons is diverse, offering numerous avenues for buying and selling.\n\n*   **Online Marketplaces:** eBay and Etsy are popular platforms for buying and selling buttons. They offer a wide selection and competitive prices. Be sure to research seller ratings and reviews before making a purchase.\n*   **Antique Shops and Flea Markets:** These are excellent places to find unique and rare buttons. You can often negotiate prices with vendors.\n*   **Button Shows and Conventions:** Button collecting clubs and organizations frequently host shows and conventions where collectors can buy, sell, and trade buttons.\n*   **Auction Houses:** High-value buttons may be sold through auction houses specializing in collectibles. This can be a good option for selling rare or historically significant buttons.\n*   **Online Button Collecting Forums:** Many online forums cater to button collectors. These forums can be a great place to connect with other collectors, buy and sell buttons, and learn more about button identification and valuation.\n*   **Consignment Shops:** Some consignment shops specializing in vintage clothing or accessories may accept button collections.\n\n**6. What are some common problems or challenges faced when identifying old buttons?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying old buttons can be challenging due to several factors.\n\n*   **Reproductions and Fakes:** Modern reproductions of antique buttons are common. Learning to distinguish between authentic old buttons and fakes is crucial. Look for signs of age, such as wear and tear, and compare the button to known examples in reference books or online resources. Newer buttons often have a smoother, more uniform finish.\n*   **Damage and Wear:** Worn or damaged buttons can be difficult to identify. Missing parts, chips, cracks, and fading can obscure key features.\n*   **Lack of Markings:** Many old buttons are unmarked, making it difficult to determine their origin or manufacturer. Researching button styles prevalent during specific historical periods can help narrow down the possibilities.\n*   **Misidentification:** Buttons can be easily misidentified if you're not familiar with different materials, designs, and manufacturing techniques. Consult with experienced collectors or button experts for assistance.\n*   **Inconsistent Terminology:** Different collectors and dealers may use different terms to describe the same type of button, which can lead to confusion.\n\n**7. What resources are available for learning more about old button identification and collecting?**\n\n**Answer:** Several resources can help you learn more about old button identification and collecting.\n\n*   **Books:** Numerous books are dedicated to button collecting, covering various aspects such as button history, identification, valuation, and care.
