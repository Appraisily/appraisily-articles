How much is a 1991 quarter worth in circulation?**\n\n**Answer:** A 1991 quarter in circulated condition, meaning it shows signs of wear and tear from being used, is generally worth only its face value: 25 cents. The vast majority of quarters from this year that you find in your pocket change will fall into this category. Their metal composition (91.67% copper and 8.33% nickel clad over a core of pure copper) means the melt value is far below the face value, so the metal itself doesn't contribute to its worth. To receive more than face value, the coin needs to be in uncirculated condition, meaning it retains its original mint luster and shows no signs of wear, or possess a significant mint error. Even then, the value increase is often modest. Factors influencing value include the coin's condition (graded by professional services like PCGS or NGC), the mint mark (Philadelphia, Denver, or San Francisco), and any potential errors. While finding a valuable circulated 1991 quarter is unlikely, always checking for mint errors or unusually high condition examples is a good practice for any coin enthusiast.\n\n**2. Are there any rare or valuable 1991 quarters that I should look for?**\n\n**Answer:** While the 1991 quarter is not inherently rare, certain factors can increase its value beyond face value. The primary thing to look for are errors. Here are a few examples:\n\n*   **Off-Center Strike:** Quarters struck significantly off-center (where the design is not fully imprinted on the planchet) can be worth several dollars, depending on the severity.\n*   **Doubled Die Obverse/Reverse:** Though not widely reported for the 1991 quarter, look closely at the lettering and design elements, especially \"LIBERTY\" and \"IN GOD WE TRUST,\" for any doubling. This is a less common but potentially valuable error.\n*   **Clashed Dies:** This error occurs when the obverse and reverse dies strike each other without a planchet in between, leaving faint impressions of the opposing design.\n\nAlso, uncirculated examples graded highly by PCGS or NGC can command a premium. A 1991-P or 1991-D quarter graded MS67 (Mint State 67 â€“ a very high grade) can fetch a few dollars. Always use reputable sources like PCGS CoinFacts or NGC's website to verify errors and values.\n\n**3. What do the mint marks on a 1991 quarter mean, and how do they affect its value?**\n\n**Answer:** The mint mark on a 1991 quarter indicates which U.S. Mint facility produced the coin. There are three potential mint marks:\n\n*   **P:** Philadelphia Mint. This mint mark is usually absent on quarters minted before 1980, but it appears on the 1991 quarters.\n*   **D:** Denver Mint.\n*   **S:** San Francisco Mint. The San Francisco Mint produced proof coins, intended for collectors, not general circulation.\n\nThe mint mark's presence, or absence, can influence the coin's value, though in the case of the 1991 quarter, the difference is usually minimal for circulated examples. The 1991-S proof quarter has a slightly higher value than the Philadelphia or Denver counterparts, especially in pristine condition. The absence of a mint mark on a 1991 quarter would be a significant error and could potentially increase its value substantially, but it is not a commonly reported error for this year. The mint mark can be found on the obverse (front) of the coin, just to the right of Washington's portrait, below the word \"TRUST\" in \"IN GOD WE TRUST\".\n\n**4. How can I tell if my 1991 quarter is a proof coin, and is it worth more?**\n\n**Answer:** A proof coin is a specially struck coin produced for collectors. They are made using polished dies and planchets, resulting in a sharper, more detailed design and a mirror-like surface. Here's how to identify a 1991 proof quarter:\n\n*   **Mirror-like Finish:** Proof coins have a highly reflective, almost mirror-like surface, both in the fields (the flat areas around the design) and on the raised design elements.\n*   **Sharp Details:** The details on a proof coin are sharply defined and well-struck.\n*   **\"S\" Mint Mark:** 1991 proof quarters were minted in San Francisco and will have an \"S\" mint mark.\n*   **Packaging:** Proof coins were originally sold in special packaging from the U.S. Mint. While the packaging may be missing, its presence is a strong indicator.\n\nA 1991-S proof quarter is worth more than a regular circulated 1991 quarter. A typical, well-preserved example might sell for a few dollars. A graded proof coin in PR69 or PR70 condition (near-perfect or perfect) can command a higher premium.\n\n**5. Where can I sell my 1991 quarter if I think it's valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** If you believe your 1991 quarter is valuable (due to condition, a mint error, or being a proof coin), several options are available for selling it:\n\n*   **Local Coin Dealers:** A local coin dealer can provide an appraisal and offer to buy the coin. Get multiple opinions for the best price.\n*   **Online Auction Sites (eBay):** eBay can be a good option for reaching a wider audience, but be sure to take clear, high-quality photos and accurately describe the coin's condition and any potential errors.\n*   **Coin Shows:** Coin shows are events where collectors and dealers buy, sell, and trade coins. This is a good place to get an expert opinion and potentially sell your coin.\n*   **Grading Services (PCGS, NGC):** If you believe your coin is particularly valuable, consider having it graded by PCGS or NGC. A graded coin is more easily sold and often commands a higher price.\n*   **Online Coin Marketplaces:** Several online platforms specialize in buying and selling coins, such as VCoins or MA-Shops.\n\nBefore selling, research comparable sales to understand the coin's market value. Be aware of fees and commissions charged by different selling platforms.\n\n**6. What factors determine the value of a 1991 quarter besides the mint mark?**\n\n**Answer:** Several factors beyond the mint mark influence the value of a 1991 quarter:\n\n*   **Condition:** This is the most significant factor. Uncirculated coins with full mint luster are worth more than circulated coins with wear and tear. Coin grading services like PCGS and NGC assign grades from 1 (Poor) to 70 (Mint State Perfect).\n*   **Errors:** As mentioned earlier, mint errors, such as off-center strikes, doubled dies, or clashed dies, can significantly increase the value of a coin.\n*   **Eye Appeal:** Even among coins of the same grade, those with better eye appeal (e.g., strong luster, attractive toning) can be worth more.\n*   **Demand:** The demand for a particular coin can fluctuate based on collector interest.\n*   **Rarity:** While the 1991 quarter is not inherently rare, specific error varieties can be scarce and therefore more valuable.\n*   **Third-Party Grading (TPG):** Coins graded by reputable TPGs like PCGS and NGC are generally more valuable because the grading process provides an independent assessment of the coin's condition.\n\n**7. Where can I find more information about 1991 quarters and their potential value?**\n\n**Answer:** Several resources offer more information about 1991 quarters and their potential value:\n\n*   **PCGS CoinFacts:** PCGS CoinFacts (PCGS.com/coinfacts) is a comprehensive online resource with information about U.S. coins, including mintage figures, grading information, and values.\n*   **NGC Coin Explorer:** NGC Coin Explorer (NGCcoin.com) is another excellent online resource offering similar information to PCGS CoinFacts.\n*   **Coin Books:** Books like \"A Guide Book of United States Coins\" (the \"Red Book\") provide general information about coin values.\n*   **Coin Collecting Forums:** Online forums like CoinTalk or the PCGS forums allow you to discuss coins with other collectors and experts.\n*   **Professional Coin Dealers:** Local coin dealers can offer appraisals and insights into coin values.\n*   **U.S. Mint Website:** The U.S. Mint's website (usmint.gov) provides historical information about coin production.\n*   **Reputable Numismatic Publications:** Publications such as *Coin World* and *Numismatic News* offer news and insights into the coin collecting hobby.
