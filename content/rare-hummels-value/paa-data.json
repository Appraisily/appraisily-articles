  "content": "**People Also Ask (rare hummels value)**\n\n**1. What makes a Hummel figurine rare and valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** Rarity and value in Hummel figurines are determined by a combination of factors. Simply being old doesn't automatically make a Hummel valuable. Instead, consider these key aspects:\n\n*   **Mold Number and Size:** Certain mold numbers are produced in smaller quantities or for shorter periods, making them scarcer. Larger sizes within a mold number are also generally more valuable. Look for variations like \"TMK-1\" or \"TMK-2\" markings (discussed later) as these can signify early production.\n*   **Trademark (TMK) Markings:** The trademark mark, located on the base, indicates the production period. Early marks (TMK-1 through TMK-3) are typically more desirable than later ones (TMK-6 and later). TMK-1, the Full Bee mark (1935-1949), is highly sought after.\n*   **Painting Variations and Errors:** Slight variations in painting, such as different colors or minor mistakes, can significantly increase value. These errors are often unique and make the figurine one-of-a-kind.\n*   **Condition:** Figurines in pristine condition, without chips, cracks, crazing, or repairs, command higher prices. Even minor damage can dramatically reduce value.\n*   **Limited Editions:** Hummel has released limited edition figurines, often commemorating special events or anniversaries. These are inherently rarer due to the restricted production numbers.\n*   **Demand:** Market demand plays a crucial role. Some figurines are simply more popular among collectors, driving up their prices.\n\nUltimately, a combination of these factors contributes to a Hummel's rarity and subsequent value.\n\n**2. How can I identify an authentic rare Hummel figurine?**\n\n**Answer:** Authenticating a Hummel figurine requires careful examination. Start by looking for these defining characteristics:\n\n*   **The Trademark (TMK):** This is the most important indicator. Familiarize yourself with the Hummel trademark history (TMK-1 through TMK-8). The \"Full Bee\" mark (TMK-1, 1935-1949) is a strong sign of age and potential value. The presence of a trademark alone doesn't guarantee authenticity; it must be a *correct* trademark for the piece's supposed age.\n*   **Mold Number:** Each Hummel figurine has a mold number, usually impressed into the base. Compare this number to known Hummel catalogs or online resources to verify its existence and description.\n*   **Goebel Mark:** Look for the Goebel mark, indicating the manufacturer. This is often located near the TMK. Some older pieces may have the \"WG\" mark (William Goebel).\n*   **Quality of Craftsmanship:** Authentic Hummels are meticulously crafted with fine details and smooth surfaces. Be wary of figurines with rough edges, poorly painted details, or uneven glazing.\n*   **Base:** The base should be flat and stable. Check for any signs of repair or alteration.\n*   **Paper Labels:** Some Hummels had paper labels, which may be missing or damaged. Their presence can further authenticate the piece, but their absence doesn't necessarily indicate a fake.\n*   **Weight:** Hummels have a certain heft due to the porcelain material. Fakes might feel lighter.\n\nIf you're unsure about a figurine's authenticity, consult with a reputable Hummel appraiser or collector.\n\n**3. What are some examples of rare and valuable Hummel figurines and their approximate values?**\n\n**Answer:** While values fluctuate based on market conditions and condition, here are a few examples of rare and valuable Hummel figurines and their *approximate* values. Remember, these are estimates, and actual prices can vary significantly:\n\n*   **\"Adventure Bound\" (#347):** This figurine, especially in larger sizes and with early trademarks (TMK-1 to TMK-3), can fetch several thousand dollars. A large, pristine example with the Full Bee mark could reach upwards of $5,000.\n*   **\"Merry Wanderer\" (#7):** While a common figurine, certain variations, especially those with early TMK marks and larger sizes, are more valuable. Expect to pay $500-$2,000 for a desirable example.\n*   **\"Ring Around the Rosie\" (#348):** Larger sizes and early trademark versions are highly sought after. Prices can range from $1,000 to $3,000, depending on condition and trademark.\n*   **\"Apple Tree Boy\" and \"Apple Tree Girl\" (#141):** These are popular and generally command higher prices than many other Hummels, especially those with early TMKs.\n*   **\"Little Fiddler\" (#4):** Early versions of \"Little Fiddler,\" particularly those with the Full Bee mark (TMK-1) in excellent condition, can be worth thousands of dollars.\n\n**Important Note:** These are just a few examples. Value is heavily influenced by condition, size, trademark, and current market demand. Consult with a professional appraiser for a more accurate assessment.\n\n**4. How does the condition of a Hummel figurine affect its value?**\n\n**Answer:** The condition of a Hummel figurine is paramount in determining its value. Collectors prioritize pieces in pristine condition, meaning free from any damage or imperfections. Here's how specific flaws impact value:\n\n*   **Chips:** Chips, even small ones, significantly decrease value. A chip on a prominent area like the face or hand is more detrimental than a chip on the base.\n*   **Cracks:** Cracks, especially those that are visible or structurally compromising, drastically reduce value. Hairline cracks may be less detrimental than large, obvious cracks.\n*   **Crazing:** Crazing refers to fine lines or cracks in the glaze. While it doesn't always significantly impact value, heavy crazing can detract from the figurine's appearance and lower its price.\n*   **Repairs:** Repaired Hummels are worth significantly less than undamaged ones. Even professionally executed repairs are often detectable and negatively affect value.\n*   **Fading:** Exposure to sunlight can cause the colors to fade, diminishing the figurine's appeal and value.\n*   **Dirt and Stains:** Heavy dirt or stains can reduce value. Cleaning can improve the appearance, but improper cleaning can also damage the figurine.\n*   **Missing Pieces:** If a figurine originally had an accessory (like a bird or a flower) and it's missing, the value will be reduced.\n\nIn general, a Hummel in excellent condition can command a significantly higher price than the same figurine in poor condition. When evaluating a Hummel, carefully inspect it under good lighting and consider its overall condition before making a purchase or determining its value.\n\n**5. Where can I find information on Hummel figurine prices and identify rare pieces?**\n\n**Answer:** Several resources can help you research Hummel figurine prices and identify rare pieces:\n\n*   **Online Auction Sites (eBay, WorthPoint):** These platforms can provide a snapshot of current market prices. Search for the specific Hummel figurine by its mold number and trademark. WorthPoint offers historical sales data, requiring a subscription.\n*   **Hummel Price Guides:** While these guides can be outdated, they offer a general overview of values. Look for recent publications, but remember that prices fluctuate.\n*   **Hummel Collector Clubs and Forums:** These communities are excellent resources for information, identification assistance, and connecting with experienced collectors.\n*   **Reputable Hummel Dealers and Appraisers:** Consulting with a professional appraiser is the best way to obtain an accurate valuation. They have the expertise to assess condition, authenticity, and market value. Look for appraisers specializing in Hummel figurines.\n*   **Goebel Catalogs and Archives:** While not readily available to the public, access to Goebel's historical catalogs can provide information on production runs and variations. Some museums and libraries may have these resources.\n*   **Books on Hummel Figurines:** Several books detail Hummel history, identification, and value. Search for titles specifically focused on rare or vintage Hummels.\n\nRemember to cross-reference information from multiple sources and consider the source's credibility. Market prices are dynamic, so stay updated on current trends.\n\n**6. What are some common mistakes to avoid when buying or selling rare Hummel figurines?**\n\n**Answer:** Buying and selling rare Hummel figurines can be tricky. Here are some common mistakes to avoid:\n\n*   **Overpaying:** Don't rely solely on a single source for pricing. Research comparable sales and consider the figurine's condition before making an offer.\n*   **Ignoring Condition:** Neglecting to thoroughly inspect a figurine for damage can lead to disappointment. Use a magnifying glass and bright light to examine it carefully.\n*   **Misinterpreting Trademarks:** Understanding the Hummel trademark history is crucial. Don't assume that all old trademarks automatically mean high value. Authenticate the mark and ensure it matches the figurine's supposed age.\n*   **Failing to Authenticate:** Don't purchase a Hummel without verifying its authenticity. Look for the correct trademark, mold number, and Goebel mark. Be wary of deals that seem too good to be true.\n*   **Improper Cleaning:** Using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners can damage the glaze and paint. Use a soft, damp cloth for gentle cleaning.\n*   **Poor Photography (for sellers):** When selling online, use clear, well-lit photos that accurately depict the figurine's condition. Show the trademark, mold number, and any flaws.\n*   **Inadequate Packaging (for sellers):** Pack figurines carefully with plenty of padding to prevent damage during shipping. Insure the package for its full value.\n*   **Lack of Due Diligence:** Rushing into a purchase or sale without conducting proper research can lead to costly mistakes.\n\n**7. Where can I buy and sell rare Hummel figurines?**\n\n**Answer:** Several avenues exist for buying and selling rare Hummel figurines:\n\n*   **Online Auction Sites (eBay, LiveAuctioneers):** These platforms offer a wide selection and can reach a large audience. Be sure to research the seller's reputation and read the descriptions carefully. For sellers, use high-quality photos and detailed descriptions.\n*   **Antique Shops and Malls:** Many antique shops specialize in collectibles, including Hummel figurines. This allows you to physically examine the pieces before purchasing.\n*   **Estate Sales:** Estate sales can be a good source for finding rare Hummels, often at reasonable prices.\n*   **Hummel Collector Clubs and Shows:** These events provide opportunities to buy, sell, and trade with other enthusiasts.\n*   **Reputable Hummel Dealers:** Dealers specialize in buying and selling Hummels and can offer expert advice and authentication services.\n*   **Consignment Shops:** Consignment shops will sell your Hummel on your behalf, taking a percentage of the sale price.\n*   **Online Marketplaces (Etsy):** While less common, some sellers list Hummels on marketplaces like Etsy.\n\nWhen buying, prioritize reputable sellers and examine the figurines carefully. When selling, accurately describe the figurine's condition and provide clear photos. Consider using insurance when shipping valuable pieces.\n",
