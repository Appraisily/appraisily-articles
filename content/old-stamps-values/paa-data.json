What makes an old stamp valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** The value of an old stamp is determined by a complex interplay of factors, going beyond simply its age. While age can contribute, it's far from the only determinant. Key factors include:\n\n*   **Rarity:** A stampâ€™s scarcity is paramount. Stamps with low print runs or those destroyed during wars become highly sought after. For example, the \"Inverted Jenny\" (1918 US airmail stamp with an upside-down airplane) is worth millions due to its printing error and limited number.\n*   **Condition:** Stamps in pristine condition, with intact perforations, vibrant colors, and original gum (the adhesive on the back), command higher prices. Creases, tears, fading, or missing perforations significantly decrease value.\n*   **Demand:** Collector interest drives prices. Certain themes, countries, or historical periods are more popular than others. For example, stamps related to early aviation or British colonial issues often have strong demand.\n*   **Errors and Varieties:** Printing errors, such as misprints, imperforate stamps (lacking perforations), or color variations, can dramatically increase a stamp's worth.\n*   **Historical Significance:** Stamps commemorating important events or featuring prominent figures can be more valuable, especially if they are tied to specific historical narratives.\n*   **Expert Authentication:** A certificate of authenticity from a reputable philatelic organization (like the Philatelic Foundation or the American Philatelic Society) significantly increases confidence and value.\n\n**2. How can I identify an old stamp?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying an old stamp can be a rewarding but sometimes challenging process. Here's a breakdown of steps and resources:\n\n*   **Country of Origin:** This is often the first and most important step. Look for the country's name, abbreviations (e.g., \"US\" for United States), or symbols.\n*   **Denomination:** The stamp's face value (e.g., 1 cent, 5 pence) is crucial. This helps narrow down the possible issues within a country.\n*   **Design:** Carefully examine the image, portrait, or symbols on the stamp. Use online stamp catalogs (like Colnect or StampWorld) to search for similar designs. Many libraries and local stamp clubs can also provide resources.\n*   **Perforations:** Note the number of perforations (the small holes around the stamp). A perforation gauge, a specialized tool, accurately measures these. Variations in perforation patterns can indicate different printings or issues.\n*   **Watermark:** Watermarks are designs pressed into the paper during manufacturing. To view a watermark, place the stamp face down on a dark surface and apply a few drops of watermark fluid (available at stamp supply stores).\n*   **Paper Type:** The type of paper (e.g., laid paper, wove paper) can also provide clues.\n*   **Date of Issue:** Look for dates on the stamp or research the postal history of the country to estimate the issue year.\n*   **Seek Expert Help:** If you're unsure, consult with a stamp dealer or a local stamp club. They can offer expertise and access to specialized catalogs.\n\n**3. Where can I find old stamps?**\n\n**Answer:** Discovering old stamps can be an exciting adventure. Here are several avenues to explore:\n\n*   **Family Archives:** Start by checking with family members. Many people inherit stamp collections or have albums tucked away in attics or basements.\n*   **Estate Sales and Auctions:** Estate sales and local auctions are excellent sources for finding stamp collections. Be sure to inspect the stamps carefully before bidding.\n*   **Flea Markets and Antique Shops:** These venues occasionally have stamp dealers or individuals selling collections. Bargains can sometimes be found, but due diligence is crucial.\n*   **Online Marketplaces:** eBay, HipStamp, and Delcampe are popular online platforms for buying and selling stamps. Be wary of misrepresented items and check seller ratings.\n*   **Stamp Clubs and Shows:** Joining a local stamp club or attending a stamp show provides access to knowledgeable collectors, dealers, and a wide range of stamps.\n*   **Charity Shops:** Sometimes, charity shops receive donations of stamp collections.\n*   **Local Libraries:** Libraries often have stamp collecting books and resources and can connect you with local stamp clubs.\n\n**4. How do I determine the value of my old stamp collection?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the value of your stamp collection requires careful assessment and research. Here's a structured approach:\n\n1.  **Identification:** Accurately identify each stamp using catalogs, online resources, or expert assistance.\n2.  **Condition Assessment:** Evaluate the condition of each stamp (perforations, centering, color, gum, etc.). Use the terms \"mint\" (unused with original gum), \"used\" (postmarked), \"fine,\" \"very fine,\" etc.\n3.  **Consult Catalogs:** Scott, Stanley Gibbons, and Michel are leading stamp catalog publishers. These catalogs provide estimated values based on condition and rarity. Note that catalog values are *retail* prices, not what you'd receive selling to a dealer.\n4.  **Online Research:** Check completed eBay listings (using the \"sold items\" filter) to see what similar stamps have recently sold for.\n5.  **Dealer Appraisal:** Obtain appraisals from multiple reputable stamp dealers. They will consider market demand and current trends. Be prepared to pay a fee for a formal appraisal.\n6.  **Auction Houses:** For potentially valuable collections, consider consigning them to a reputable stamp auction house. They have expertise in marketing and selling high-value stamps.\n7.  **Consider Professional Grading:** For particularly valuable stamps, consider having them professionally graded by companies like the Professional Stamp Experts (PSE) or the American Philatelic Society (APS). Grading provides an objective assessment of condition and authenticity.\n\n**5. What are some common mistakes people make when trying to value old stamps?**\n\n**Answer:** Many pitfalls can lead to inaccurate valuations of old stamps. Avoid these common mistakes:\n\n*   **Overestimating Value Based on Age:** Age alone doesn't guarantee value. A common, poorly preserved stamp from the 1800s might be worth less than a rare, well-preserved stamp from the 1950s.\n*   **Ignoring Condition:** Condition is paramount. Even a rare stamp in poor condition will be worth significantly less.\n*   **Relying Solely on Catalog Values:** Stamp catalogs provide *retail* prices, which are often higher than what a dealer will pay. They are a starting point, not a definitive valuation.\n*   **Assuming Online Price Guides are Always Accurate:** Some online price guides are outdated or inaccurate. Verify information with multiple sources.\n*   **Failing to Identify Stamps Correctly:** Misidentifying a stamp can lead to incorrect valuation.\n*   **Neglecting to Check for Watermarks:** Watermarks can differentiate between common and rare varieties of the same stamp.\n*   **Ignoring the Gum:** Original gum (the adhesive on the back) is highly desirable for unused stamps. However, stamps with disturbed or damaged gum are worth less.\n*   **Cleaning Stamps Improperly:** Attempting to clean stamps yourself can easily damage them, reducing their value. Leave cleaning to professionals.\n\n**6. Are stamps with postmarks worth less than unused stamps?**\n\n**Answer:** Generally, *used* stamps (those with postmarks) are worth less than *mint* or *unused* stamps in the same condition. This is because unused stamps retain their original gum and are considered to be in a more pristine state. However, there are exceptions to this rule:\n\n*   **Rarity:** A postmarked stamp from a rare issue might be worth more than an unused common stamp. The scarcity of the stamp, regardless of its postmark, is the primary driver of value.\n*   **Cancellation Type:** Some postmarks are highly sought after by collectors. For example, a stamp with a specific error in the cancellation, a rare town marking, or a commemorative postmark related to an important event can increase its value.\n*   **Postal History:** Stamps affixed to covers (envelopes) with interesting postal markings or significant historical context can be very valuable to postal history collectors. These covers tell a story about the stamp's journey and the postal system of the time.\n*   **Proof of Use:** A stamp on a cover provides indisputable proof that it was actually used for its intended purpose. This can be particularly important for stamps that are easily forged.\n\n**7. What is the best way to store and preserve old stamps?**\n\n**Answer:** Proper storage and preservation are crucial for maintaining the value and condition of your old stamps. Here's a guide:\n\n*   **Stamp Albums:** Use acid-free stamp albums with clear pockets or mounts to protect stamps from dust, fingerprints, and damage. Avoid albums with PVC (polyvinyl chloride) pockets, as they can damage stamps over time.\n*   **Hingeless Mounts:** Hingeless mounts are small, clear plastic holders that adhere to the album page and hold the stamp securely without damaging the gum.\n*   **Stockbooks:** Stockbooks are useful for storing duplicate stamps or stamps that are not yet mounted in an album. Choose stockbooks with acid-free pages and glassine strips.\n*   **Climate Control:** Store your stamp collection in a cool, dry, and dark environment. Avoid direct sunlight, humidity, and extreme temperature fluctuations, as these can cause fading, discoloration, and damage to the paper and gum.\n*   **Handling Precautions:** Always handle stamps with clean, dry hands or use stamp tongs (tweezers with rounded ends) to avoid damaging the perforations or leaving fingerprints.\n*   **Acid-Free Materials:** Use only acid-free paper, mounts, and albums to prevent the paper from yellowing and becoming brittle.\n*   **Avoid Adhesives:** Never use glue, tape, or other adhesives directly on stamps.\n*   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect your collection for signs of damage, such as mold, mildew, or insect infestation.\n",
