Okay, I need to tackle this query about the value of antique end tables. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to make sure I cover everything thoroughly. 

First, understanding what antique end tables value means. From the search results, it's clear that value is determined by factors like age, condition, materials, and craftsmanship. The user wants to know why this is important, so I should highlight aspects like historical significance and investment potential. Sources [1] and [12] mention appraisals and market trends, which will be useful here.

Next, the historical background. The YouTube video [1] talks about different eras like Queen Anne and Victorian, while [2] and [5] discuss the evolution from trestle tables to more elaborate designs. I need to connect the development of end tables to their increasing value over time, maybe touching on specific periods like the 17th-18th centuries versus replicas.

Types and variations. The user wants categories. Search result [3] differentiates between occasional and end tables, and [10] mentions Art Nouveau and Mid-Century trends. I should list styles like Chippendale, Victorian, and Art Deco, using examples from [7] and [14] where specific tables are described.

Factors determining value. Condition, era, and aesthetics are key from [1] and [12]. Also, materials like mahogany or walnut from [13] and [7]. Authenticity checks from [1] and [5] include dovetail joints and screws. I need to explain each factor with examples, maybe citing how a Queen Anne table is more valuable than a Victorian one.

Identifying authenticity. The YouTube guide [1] mentions joints and symmetry, while [5] talks about table legs and wood types. I should outline steps like checking for handmade dovetails, irregular screws, and maker's marks. Including examples like Chippendale's imperfections from [1] would help.

Market trends. Sources [6], [10], and [13] indicate a resurgence in dark woods and Art Nouveau. Mentioning current prices from [7] and [12], like the $1,695 walnut table, gives concrete data points. Also, the shift towards sustainable furniture in [6] and [13] is a trend to highlight.

Where to buy/sell. Results [4], [7], [9], and [14] list places like Chairish, Big Whale Consignment, and auction houses. I should categorize these into online platforms, auctions, antique shops, and fairs, maybe noting exclusive collections from NEWEL [14].

Care and maintenance. Tips from [8] and [11] include dusting, avoiding sunlight, and professional restoration. Emphasize using soft cloths and proper climate control, as well as handling techniques to preserve value.

I need to structure each section with headers, use specific examples, and cite sources appropriately. Make sure to avoid lists with single items and use tables where comparisons are needed. Also, check that all eight points are addressed comprehensively with relevant data from the provided search results. Let me organize the sections and ensure each part flows logically, citing sources as I go.

Antique end tables hold significant value as historical artifacts, design pieces, and investment assets. Their worth stems from craftsmanship, materials, historical context, and market demand. Below is a comprehensive analysis structured around key aspects of their valuation and significance.

## 1. Definition and Importance of Antique End Table Value  
Antique end table value refers to the monetary and historical worth of small side tables typically placed beside seating furniture. These pieces are prized for:  
- **Craftsmanship**: Hand-carved details, joinery techniques (e.g., dovetail joints), and materials like mahogany or walnut[1][5].  
- **Historical Significance**: Tables from the 17th–18th centuries reflect design movements like Chippendale or Queen Anne[1][2].  
- **Aesthetic Appeal**: Patina, decorative elements (e.g., scrolled feet), and preservation of original finishes[1][3].  
- **Investment Potential**: Rare pieces appreciate due to scarcity, with auction prices for 18th-century tables reaching $20,000+[12][14].

## 2. Historical Development  
Antique end tables evolved alongside furniture design trends:  
- **17th–18th Centuries**: Early examples featured pedestal bases and cabriole legs (Queen Anne style)[1][2].  
- **Victorian Era**: Ornate carvings, dark woods, and marble tops became popular[3][5].  
- **20th Century**: Mid-century modern designs emphasized minimalist lines and tapered legs[7][13].  
- **Modern Replicas**: Post-1950s reproductions mimic historical styles but lack handmade details[1][5].

## 4. Value Determinants  
Key factors influencing appraisal:  
- **Condition**: Original finishes and structural integrity increase value; repairs reduce it by 30–50%[1][12].  
- **Provenance**: Tables with documented makers (e.g., Thomas Chippendale) command premiums[1][14].  
- **Materials**: Rare woods (e.g., tiger oak) or metals (brass inlays) elevate prices[7][11].  
- **Era**: Pre-1900 tables are 2–3x more valuable than 20th-century replicas[1][6].  
- **Pairing**: Matching sets sell for 40% more than individual tables[7][14].  

---

## 5. Authenticity Identification  
- **Joints**: Hand-cut dovetails with irregular spacing (machine-cut joints indicate replicas)[1][5].  
- **Hardware**: Single-slot, non-tapered screws (pre-1850) vs. modern Phillips heads[1][5].  
- **Symmetry**: Slight imperfections in carvings or legs signal handmade construction[1][14].  
- **Patina**: Natural aging creates soft sheen; refinishing diminishes value[11][12].  

---

## 6. Market Trends (2025)  
- **Demand Surge**: Art Nouveau and dark wood tables (walnut, mahogany) dominate auctions[10][13].  
- **Pricing Range**:  
  - Victorian marble-top tables: $1,200–$3,500[7][12]  
  - Mid-century walnut sets: $1,695–$2,395[7]  
  - 18th-century Chippendale: $15,000–$25,000[12][14]  
- **Sustainability Focus**: Buyers prioritize eco-friendly antiques over mass-produced furniture[6][13].  

---

## 7. Acquisition and Sales Channels  
- **Auctions**: Major houses like Christie’s specialize in pre-1900 pieces[12][14].  
- **Online Marketplaces**: Chairish and 1stDibs offer verified 20th-century tables[4][10].  
- **Antique Shops**: Local dealers (e.g., Saugatuck Antique Pavilion) provide appraisals[11][14].  
- **Fairs**: Brimfield Antique Show features rare finds at negotiable prices[6][10].  

---

## 8. Preservation Guidelines  
- **Cleaning**: Dust with lint-free cloths; avoid polishes that strip patina[8][11].  
- **Environment**: Maintain 40–60% humidity to prevent wood warping[8][11].  
- **Sunlight**: Use UV-filtering window film to protect finishes[11].  
- **Restoration**: Consult professionals for repairs; DIY efforts risk devaluation[11][12].
