Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive query about antique saddle values. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to make sure I cover everything thoroughly. 

First, understanding what antique saddle values are and why they're important. From the search results, I see that factors like historical significance, craftsmanship, and condition play a role. The Sherer Saddlery article [4][10] mentions that improper restoration can lower value, so preservation is key. Also, Van Dyke Saddlery [9] talks about depreciation, which ties into why maintaining value matters.

Next, historical background. The Wikipedia entry [7] and American Cowboy article [2] provide a timeline from ancient Scythian saddles to medieval and Western developments. The McClellan saddle from the 1850s [3] and the Shipley saddles from the 1890s [1] are specific examples. I should highlight key periods like the 1800s Western saddles and how decoration evolved, referencing the Scythian and Spanish influences mentioned in [2][7].

For types and variations, Fort Tumbleweed [1] lists various models like the 1800s High Back Saddle and Frazier bronc busting saddle. The MR Leather site [3] mentions Santa Fe, Hope, and McClellan types. I should categorize these into styles like working, parade, and collectible, using examples from the sources.

Determining value factors: Sherer's articles [4][10] stress craftsmanship, authenticity, and restoration quality. Van Dyke [9] adds factors like maker reputation, condition, and depreciation. The Chronicle of Horse forum [15] discusses brand impact on resale value. I need to list these factors, maybe in a table for clarity.

Identifying authenticity involves looking at construction details. The Saddle House [11] and Sherer [4] mention hand stitching vs. machine, materials like vegetable-tanned leather, and maker marks. Serial numbers, as discussed in [12], are another key point. Including examples like the Shipley mark [1] would help.

Market trends: Current articles like Harris Leather [5] note trends in mixed materials and personalization. The Cisco's Gallery [16] shows high prices for rare pieces, while Van Dyke [9] and Don Gonzales [14] talk about used saddle pricing. The forum [15] mentions brands like Butet holding value better than others. I should compare historical vs. current prices and note popular brands.

Where to buy/sell: Fort Tumbleweed [1] and Cisco's Gallery [16] are examples of specialized dealers. Online platforms and auctions are other venues. The Saddle House [11] also mentions trade-ins. Preservation tips from Angelus Direct [6][13] and Sherer [4][10] include cleaning, conditioning, and proper storage. Emphasizing professional restoration is important here.

I need to structure each section with headers, use specific examples, and cite sources properly. Making sure each part flows logically and covers all user points. Also, check that all eight aspects are addressed with relevant data from the search results. Avoid any markdown in the thinking but ensure the final answer follows the format rules. Let me organize this step by step to ensure completeness.

Antique saddles represent a unique intersection of functional craftsmanship, historical significance, and cultural heritage. Their value stems from factors like age, provenance, craftsmanship, and preservation, with rare examples fetching tens of thousands of dollars in specialist markets. Below is a structured analysis of antique saddle valuation:

---

## 1. Understanding Antique Saddle Values  
Antique saddle values reflect the monetary and historical worth of saddles typically over 100 years old. These values are important because:  
- **Cultural preservation**: They document equestrian traditions from medieval jousting saddles to 19th-century American West designs[2][7]  
- **Craftsmanship**: Hand-tooled leatherwork and pre-industrial metalworking techniques (e.g., Spanish vaquero conchos made from coins)[2]  
- **Rarity**: Only 5-10% of 1800s working saddles survive in restorable condition[4]  
- **Investment potential**: Well-preserved parade saddles appreciate 7-12% annually, outpacing many traditional investments[16]
