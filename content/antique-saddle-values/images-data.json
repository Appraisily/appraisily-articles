    "prompt": "Photorealistic image of a weathered antique Western saddle resting on a rustic wooden workbench in a well-lit workshop. Close-up focus on the intricate hand-tooled leather details near the cantle. The hands of an unseen appraiser, perhaps wearing leather gloves, gently hold a magnifying glass over a subtle maker's mark stamped into the fender. Leatherworking tools like awls and edgers are scattered neatly on the bench nearby. Warm, focused lighting from a low-hanging lamp highlights the saddle's rich texture and patina against a softly blurred background of workshop shelves holding supplies. Professional, documentary style, emphasizing the inspection process for valuation. --ar 16:9 --style raw",

    "prompt": "Museum-quality photograph capturing a highly ornate antique Western parade saddle, possibly Bohlin or Visalia style, featuring intricate silver conchos, detailed floral tooling, and a silver-wrapped horn, displayed prominently on a minimalist, dark velvet-draped stand. The saddle is positioned slightly off-center (following rule of thirds) against a very dark, subtly textured studio backdrop. Dramatic, gallery-style spotlighting from above and slightly to the front illuminates the polished silver, creating sharp highlights and deep shadows within the tooling, emphasizing its exceptional craftsmanship and high value. Ultra-realistic, high-definition, elegant aesthetic, showcasing a top-tier collectible. --ar 16:9 --style raw",

A single, well-preserved antique English dressage saddle rests on an old, weathered wooden saddle rack positioned on the right third of the frame. Golden hour sunlight streams dramatically through dusty gaps in the barn's wooden slat walls, creating visible light rays that illuminate the saddle and highlight dust motes in the air. The background shows the texture of old wood, faint outlines of empty stalls, and perhaps some old horse tack hanging on pegs in the deeper shadows.

The image captures the intricate hand-stitching along the edge of the saddle skirt, showing the texture of the aged leather, the individual threads, and the slight patina of wear. Alternatively, the focus could be on a beautifully engraved silver cantle plate or a clearly legible, deeply stamped maker's mark (e.g., 'Heiser Denver'). Soft, directional lighting skims across the surface, emphasizing the tactile quality, fine craftsmanship, and the character imparted by age. Extremely shallow depth of field ensures the background is smoothly blurred, isolating the detail. High-detail, textural focus. --ar 16:9 --style raw",
