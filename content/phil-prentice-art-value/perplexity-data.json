His works were reproduced by Donald Art Co., and he had exhibitions in the 70s. \n\nResult 4 is eBay listings showing his art prices, ranging from around $28 to over $200. This gives current market examples. Result 5 from Antique Arena mentions a leopard print sold for $64 with a buyer premium, indicating some pieces are auctioned. Result 6 on Chairish lists a vintage leopard fabric art for $30, showing varied mediums. \n\nResult 7 is a HiBid auction listing a cougar print, which is upcoming in 2024. Result 8 is IMDb for a different Phil Prentice, an actor, so irrelevant. Result 9 from Poshmark shows a sold lion artwork for $30, suggesting lower-priced items. Result 10 is a 1960s tiger art board priced at $25, indicating some affordability. \n\nResult 11 from Simpson Galleries lists an elephant painting estimated $200-$300, giving a higher-end example. Result 12 on EverybodyWiki provides a bio, noting his scholarship, military service, and transition to fine arts. Result 13 is his about page, detailing his career, exhibitions, and current status. Result 14 from Vinterior has a tiger print at £35, showing international availability. Result 15 is about a business plan unrelated to art. Result 16 is a gallery image from Donald Art Co.\n\nNow, structuring the response into the eight sections:\n\n1. **Definition and Importance**: Phil Prentice's art value stems from his wildlife depictions, historical significance in wildlife art, and limited reproductions. His works are valued for detail and rarity.\n\n2. **Historical Background**: Born 1930, studied under notable cartoonists, transitioned to fine arts in the 60s, gained recognition in the 70s with Donald Art Co. reproductions, exhibitions, and international presence.\n\n3. **Types and Variations**: Original oils, acrylics, lithographs, fabric art, and reproductions. Subjects include African wildlife, Southwest landscapes, Native American portraits, and human figures.\n\n4. **Value Determinants**: Authenticity (signatures, provenance), medium (originals vs. prints), condition, subject matter (big cats are popular), market demand.\n\n5. **Identifying Authenticity**: Check signatures, provenance, compare with known works, consult experts or databases like his official site.\n\n6. **Market Trends**: Originals fetch higher prices ($200-$300+), prints vary ($25-$200). Auctions and online platforms show steady demand, especially for well-preserved pieces.\n\n7. **Buying/Selling Venues**: eBay, Etsy, Chairish, auctions (HiBid, Simpson Galleries), specialty galleries, his official website for remaining originals.\n\n8. **Preservation Tips**: Avoid direct sunlight, control humidity, gentle cleaning, professional framing, proper handling.\n\nI need to ensure each section is detailed with examples from the sources. For instance, in market trends, citing specific eBay listings and auction estimates. Also, mention his exhibitions and recognition by the U.S. Information Agency. Highlight factors like medium and subject matter affecting value, using the elephant painting estimate as a case study. \n\nMake sure to cite sources properly, like [3] for his background, [4][5][11] for pricing examples, and [13] for his career milestones. Avoid lists, use paragraphs, and maintain a formal tone. Check that all eight aspects are covered thoroughly, integrating data points from the search results to support each section.\n</think>\n\n# The Comprehensive Guide to Phil Prentice Art Value  \n\nPhil Prentice (1930–present) is an American wildlife artist whose works have garnered attention for their intricate detail, emotional depth, and historical significance in the realm of animal portraiture.
