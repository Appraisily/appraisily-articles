Okay, I need to tackle this query about antique lamp appraisal. Let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects. Let me go through each point one by one, using the provided search results.

First, what is antique lamp appraisal and why is it important? From the sources, especially [2] and [7], appraisals determine a lamp's value for restoration, insurance, or sale. It's crucial to know the worth before investing in repairs. Importance includes financial decisions and preserving historical value.

Next, historical background. Sources [4] and [8] mention Tiffany Studios and the evolution of lamp designs. Appraisal practices likely developed alongside the collectibility of lamps, especially with famous makers like Tiffany and Handel. The early 20th century saw the rise of these collectibles, necessitating appraisal methods.

Types of appraisals: From [2], [7], and [15], there are insurance, market value, and donation appraisals. Each serves different purposes, like insurance requiring replacement value, while market value is for sales.

Factors affecting value: Age, condition, maker, materials, and provenance are key. Sources [1], [7], and [8] all highlight these. For example, Tiffany lamps with original markings are more valuable. Rarity and demand also play roles, as seen in [4] where a Tiffany lamp sold for millions.

Identifying authentic appraisals: Marks and craftsmanship are critical. Handel lamps have specific markings [6], and Tiffany's have signatures [4]. Experts check for hand-painted details versus machine-made reproductions [1].

Current market trends: Sustainability is a trend [10], and certain styles like mid-century modern are popular [13]. Auction results from [12] show high prices for stained glass lamps. The market values original condition but also restored pieces if done properly [8].

Where to buy/sell: Auctions like Fontaine's [12][15] and specialists like Cottone [4] are mentioned. Online platforms and antique dealers are also options. Provenance is important here.

Care and maintenance: Avoid direct sunlight, gentle cleaning, professional restoration. Sources [8] and [14] mention handling with care to preserve value. Electrical components might need updating, but original parts are preferable.

I need to structure this into sections with headers, include examples like Tiffany's high auction prices, case studies from Fontaine's sales, and data points like the $3.37 million sale. Make sure each section cites relevant sources, using up to three per point. Also, check that all eight aspects are covered thoroughly with specific info from the search results.
