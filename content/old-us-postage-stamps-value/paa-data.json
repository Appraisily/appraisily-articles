How do I know if my old US postage stamps are valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the value of old US postage stamps involves several factors. First, condition is paramount. Stamps in pristine condition, without creases, tears, or thinning, and with full original gum (if applicable), are worth significantly more. Second, rarity plays a crucial role. Stamps with printing errors, unusual perforations, or limited print runs are often highly sought after. Third, demand influences value. Some stamp designs or themes are simply more popular than others.\n\n*   **Begin by identifying the stamp:** Use online resources like the Scott Catalogue (a standard reference guide, though behind a paywall), the Smithsonian National Postal Museum website, or specialized stamp collecting websites to match your stamp's design and details.\n*   **Check for errors:** Look closely for any misprints, inverted designs, or missing colors. These can dramatically increase value.\n*   **Assess the condition:** Examine the stamp under good lighting and, ideally, with a magnifying glass. Look for any imperfections.\n*   **Consult a professional appraiser:** If you believe you have a potentially valuable stamp, consider consulting a reputable stamp dealer or appraiser. They can provide a more accurate assessment of its value and authenticity. Remember, online estimations can be misleading, especially without a thorough examination.\n\n**2. What makes a US postage stamp rare?**\n\n**Answer:** Several factors contribute to the rarity of a US postage stamp. Printing errors are a major cause. These can include inverted centers (like the famous Inverted Jenny), double prints, missing colors, or imperforate stamps (stamps without the perforated edges that allow easy separation). These errors often occur in only a small number of sheets before being corrected, making them exceedingly rare.\n\n*   **Limited Print Runs:** Some stamps were only printed in small quantities, either due to low demand at the time or because they were experimental issues.\n*   **Usage and Survival Rate:** Even if a stamp was initially produced in large numbers, its rarity can increase if very few examples survived in good condition. This is particularly true for stamps used on envelopes (covers) with interesting postal markings or historical significance.\n*   **Specialized Varieties:** Within a single stamp issue, there can be variations in paper type, watermark, or perforation size, all of which can affect rarity. Identifying these requires specialized knowledge and often the use of stamp collecting tools.\n*   **Post Office Errors:** Stamps that were issued in error or withdrawn from sale shortly after release can also become rare.\n\n**3. How can I find out the value of my old US postage stamps online?**\n\n**Answer:** While online resources can offer a *general* idea of your old US postage stamps' value, they should be considered a starting point, not a definitive assessment. Many websites offer stamp identification tools and price guides, but these typically provide ranges based on average condition and market demand.\n\n*   **Use reputable stamp identification websites:** Websites like Stampworld.com, Colnect.com, and HipStamp (especially for sold listings) can help you identify your stamp and see examples of similar stamps that have been sold.\n*   **Search eBay completed listings:** Filtering eBay searches to show \"completed listings\" allows you to see what stamps similar to yours have actually sold for recently. This is a more realistic indication of market value than asking prices.\n*   **Beware of inflated online valuations:** Many websites offer free stamp appraisals that are often grossly inflated to entice you to sell to them. Be skeptical of any site that promises extremely high values without a physical examination.\n*   **Focus on condition:** Online price guides often assume near-perfect condition. If your stamp has any flaws, its value will be significantly lower.\n*   **Consider a professional appraisal:** For potentially valuable stamps, a professional appraisal from a reputable stamp dealer is the most accurate way to determine value.\n\n**4. Are all old postage stamps valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** No, the vast majority of old postage stamps are not particularly valuable. While age is a factor, it's not the sole determinant of value. Many common stamps were printed in large quantities and are readily available, making them worth only a few cents or dollars, even if they are decades old. Scarcity, condition, and demand are the key factors that drive up the price of a stamp.\n\n*   **Common Commemoratives:** Many commemorative stamps from the mid-20th century onward were printed in vast quantities and are very common.\n*   **Definitive Stamps:** Definitive stamps (those used for everyday postage) also exist in large numbers, especially those from periods of high postal usage.\n*   **Condition Matters:** Even relatively scarce stamps lose significant value if they are damaged, heavily cancelled, or have missing perforations.\n*   **The \"Penny Black\" Myth:** While the Penny Black (the world's first adhesive postage stamp) is historically significant, it's not exceptionally rare or valuable because so many examples have survived.\n*   **Focus on Rarities:** Value is typically found in stamps with errors, unusual varieties, or those that were issued in very limited quantities.\n\n**5. Where can I sell my old US postage stamps?**\n\n**Answer:** There are several avenues for selling old US postage stamps, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\n*   **Stamp Dealers:** Selling to a local or online stamp dealer is a straightforward option. They will assess your stamps and offer you a price. However, be prepared to receive a wholesale price, as they need to make a profit. Get quotes from multiple dealers to ensure you're getting a fair offer.\n*   **Auction Houses:** For potentially valuable stamps or collections, selling through a reputable stamp auction house can be a good option. They will handle the marketing and bidding process, potentially reaching a wider audience of collectors. However, auction houses charge commissions on the sale price.\n*   **Online Marketplaces:** Platforms like eBay and HipStamp allow you to sell your stamps directly to collectors. This can potentially yield higher prices, but it requires more effort on your part, including taking photos, writing descriptions, and handling shipping.\n*   **Stamp Shows:** Attending a local stamp show can provide an opportunity to sell your stamps to dealers or collectors directly.\n*   **Consider the Value:** If your stamps are only worth a few dollars, the effort of selling them may not be worthwhile. Consider donating them to a charity or educational institution instead.\n\n**6. What is \"gum\" on a postage stamp, and why is it important for value?**\n\n**Answer:** \"Gum\" refers to the adhesive coating on the back of unused postage stamps. It's the original glue that allows the stamp to be affixed to an envelope. Gum is a critical factor in determining the value of unused stamps, especially older ones. A stamp with \"original gum\" (OG) is generally worth more than one that is \"hinged\" (used with a stamp hinge, which damages the gum) or \"regummed\" (artificially regummed to appear like original gum).\n\n*   **Full Original Gum (FOG):** This is the ideal condition for gum, indicating that the stamp has never been hinged or used.\n*   **Original Gum, Never Hinged (OGNH):** This is the most desirable gum condition and commands the highest premium.\n*   **Hinged:** Stamps that have been hinged typically have disturbed or damaged gum, reducing their value.\n*   **Regummed:** Regumming is a process where adhesive is reapplied to a stamp, often to make it appear more valuable. Regummed stamps are generally worth less than original gum stamps because the originality is lost.\n*   **No Gum (NG):** Stamps with no gum are generally worth significantly less than those with original gum, especially for older issues. The presence and condition of the gum are key indicators of a stamp's overall condition and originality.\n\n**7. What are some common mistakes people make when trying to value their old stamps?**\n\n**Answer:** Many people make errors when trying to assess the value of their old stamps, leading to disappointment or missed opportunities. Understanding these common pitfalls can help you avoid them.\n\n*   **Overestimating Condition:** People often overestimate the condition of their stamps. Even minor flaws, such as a slightly bent corner or a light crease, can significantly reduce value.\n*   **Ignoring Perforation Condition:** The perforations (the little holes that allow you to tear the stamps apart) are crucial. Missing, blunted, or damaged perforations can drastically reduce value.\n*   **Assuming Age Equals Value:** As mentioned earlier, age alone doesn't guarantee value. Many old stamps are common and not worth much.\n*   **Relying on Asking Prices:** Looking at asking prices on online marketplaces can be misleading. Focus on *sold* listings to see what people are actually paying.\n*   **Ignoring the Back of the Stamp:** The back of the stamp, including the gum (if present), is just as important as the front. Look for hinge remnants, staining, or other damage.\n*   **Not Seeking Professional Advice:** For potentially valuable stamps, don't rely solely on online research. Consult a reputable stamp dealer or appraiser for a professional assessment.\n*   **Cleaning Stamps:** Never attempt to clean or repair stamps yourself. This can often do more harm than good and reduce their value.\n",
