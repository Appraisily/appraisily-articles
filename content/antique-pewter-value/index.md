Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive query about antique pewter value. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to ensure I cover everything thoroughly. 

First, understanding what antique pewter value is and why it's important. From the search results, I see that pewter's value comes from its historical significance, craftsmanship, and collectibility. The user wants to know why it's valuable, so I should mention factors like age, rarity, and maker's marks. The Pewter Society's auctions and examples from sources like AE Williams and the Mary Rose shipwreck could be good examples here.

Next, the historical background. The search results mention pewter dating back to ancient Egypt and Rome, with peaks in the 17th century. The Roman occupation of Britain and the Tudor period are key points. Including the Mary Rose and Punta Cana shipwrecks as case studies would add depth. Also, the shift from lead-containing pewter to modern lead-free alloys is important for historical context.

Different types and categories of antique pewter. The search results list items like tankards, teapots, pilgrim signs, and Georgian tankards. I should categorize these into functional vs. decorative, and perhaps by era or region. The top 10 list from AE Williams and the distinction between British, European, and American pewter would help here.

Determining factors for value. The sources mention age, condition, maker's marks, rarity, and provenance. I need to elaborate on each, maybe using examples like Sir Thomas Curtis's marks or the Pilgrim signs. Also, the presence of quality marks like the crowned rose from the Pewter Society's info is crucial.

Identifying authentic pewter. Touch marks, quality marks, and wear patterns are key. The Pewter Society's database and the advice to consult experts are important here. Mentioning common fakes and the importance of expert appraisal would be necessary.

Current market trends. The user provided data up to 2025, so I should note the demand for specific items like Georgian tankards or medieval pilgrim signs. The Homes & Antiques 2025 trends mention sustainability and provenance, which aligns with the antique market's shift. Also, the Texas Renaissance Festival's collectible pewter vessels show a niche market.

Where to buy or sell. The search results suggest antique dealers, fairs, online platforms like eBay, and specialized auctions by the Pewter Society. Regional preferences, like British pewter selling better in English-speaking countries, should be highlighted. The iScrapApp for scrap value is another point.

Care and maintenance. Avoiding moisture and harsh chemicals, proper cleaning, and storage away from sunlight are mentioned. The CLAN article's tips on gentle cleaning and professional conservation for antiques are useful. Also, the note about not over-polishing to preserve patina is important.

I need to structure each section with headers, use specific examples from the sources, and cite them appropriately. Make sure to include data points like tin prices for scrap value and auction prices from the TRF Dragonslayer guide. Also, check that all eight points are addressed with relevant details and that the answer flows logically from one section to the next. Avoid any markdown formatting as per the instructions and ensure citations are correctly placed after each relevant sentence. Finally, wrap up with a concise summary that ties all the sections together.

Pewter has been valued for its craftsmanship and historical significance since ancient times, with its worth determined by factors ranging from age to maker’s marks. Here’s a detailed breakdown of antique pewter value for collectors and researchers:

---

## 1. What Is Antique Pewter Value?  
Antique pewter value refers to the monetary and historical worth of items made from pewter, a malleable alloy historically composed of tin (85–99%), lead, copper, or antimony. Its importance stems from:  
- **Historical significance**: Pewter artifacts provide insights into daily life, trade, and craftsmanship across eras[7][8].  
- **Collectibility**: Rare pieces, such as 17th-century tankards or medieval pilgrim signs, attract premium prices[3][12].  
- **Material value**: Scrap pewter trades at $3–$5 per pound (50% of tin’s market price), but antique pieces often exceed this due to provenance[1][10].  

---

## 2. Historical Background  
Pewter’s use dates to **3500 BCE** in Egypt and **1450 BCE** in China[2][7]. Key developments include:  
- **Roman and Tudor eras**: Romans introduced pewter to Britain; Tudor households used it widely as an affordable alternative to silver[8].  
- **17th–18th century peak**: Pewter tankards, plates, and teapots dominated European households[7]. Shipwrecks like the *Mary Rose* (1545) revealed pewter marked by makers like Sir Thomas Curtis[8].  
- **Modern shifts**: Post-1820, pewter declined with porcelain’s rise but resurged in decorative collectibles[7][9].  

---

## 3. Types and Categories  
Antique pewter is categorized by:  
- **Function**:  
  - **Tableware**: Tankards, spoons, plates (e.g., 17th-century English plates: $100–$200)[3][16].  
  - **Religious/ceremonial**: Medieval pilgrim signs, communion cups[3].  
- **Era/region**:  
  - **Georgian-era pewter**: Lidded tankards ($166–$297)[3][14].  
  - **American vs. British**: U.S. pieces command higher prices domestically[1][16].  
- **Rarity**: Figural tankards, pre-1820 plates, and limited-edition modern works (e.g., Texas Renaissance Festival steins: $81–$350)[14].

## 4. Value Determinants  
Key factors include:  
| Factor | Impact | Example |  
|--------|--------|---------|  
| **Age** | Older = higher value | 17th-century spoons > 19th-century reproductions[3][16] |  
| **Marks** | Maker’s touch marks boost value | Sir Thomas Curtis-marked pieces[8] |  
| **Condition** | Minimal wear, no repairs | Dented items lose 30–50% value[4][12] |  
| **Provenance** | Documented history | Pieces from shipwrecks or notable collections[8][14] |  
| **Rarity** | Unique designs or limited runs | Medieval pilgrim signs (highly sought)[3] |  

---

## 5. Authenticity Identification  
- **Touch marks**: Look for stamped initials, symbols, or quality marks (e.g., crowned rose for British guild standards)[5][16].  
- **Material testing**: Pre-1820 pewter contains lead; modern versions use antimony[7].  
- **Patina**: Authentic pieces show soft, dull finishes with minor scratches[3][6].  
- **Expert verification**: The Pewter Society offers member databases for mark identification[5].

## 6. Market Trends (2024–2025)  
- **Demand spikes**: Georgian tankards, medieval pilgrim signs, and 18th-century teapots[3][9].  
- **Sustainability focus**: Buyers prioritize eco-friendly antiques, favoring repurposed pewter[9][13].  
- **Regional markets**: British pewter sells best in Anglophone countries; U.S. Midwest favors local pieces[1][16].  
- **Pricing**:  
  - Scrap: $3–$5/lb[1]  
  - Collectibles: $100–$350+ for rare items[3][14]

- **Storage**: Keep in cool, dry areas away from sunlight to prevent warping[6].  
- **Conservation**: For antique leaded pewter, avoid harsh chemicals; consult professionals for repairs[6][7].
