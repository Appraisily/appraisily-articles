      "question": "How can you tell if pewter is an antique?",
      "snippet": "Unlike many categories of antiques, most old pewter was marked with a \"touchmark\" that can be used to identify a piece as to maker, age, and place of origin. In London, such was law. Often, these maker marks are worn so that only a fragment remains. Most touchmarks made before 1820 are sophisticated and artistic.",
