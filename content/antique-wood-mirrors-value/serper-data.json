      "question": "How can I tell how old a mirror is?",
      "snippet": "The older a mirror is, the more inconsistency you can see in its reflection. Sometimes, there are clear signs of age, such as spotting, but mirrors also tend to become wavier the older they are. Antique mirrors made in the latter half of the nineteenth century onwards tend to be much thinner than older examples.",

      "question": "What does the back of an antique mirror look like?",
      "snippet": "The mirror coating on the back of an antique mirror tends to oxidize or tarnish over time, whether made with tin and mercury or a thin sheet of silver. Dark or blotchy spots become visible through the glass, defining it as an antique. The frame can also indicate the status of an antique mirror.",

      "question": "How do you tell if you have a mercury mirror?",
      "snippet": "Tip: Place a rod (pen or toothpick) on the mirror. If the point touching the mirror looks like it is directly ``touching'' its reflection, the glass layer is thin enough and the mirror is probably modern. On the other hand, if the point is separate from its reflection, then it is probably mercury (prior to 1835).",
