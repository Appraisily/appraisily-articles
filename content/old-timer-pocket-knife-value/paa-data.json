What is an \"Old Timer\" pocket knife and what makes it collectible?**\n\n**Answer:** \"Old Timer\" refers to a line of pocket knives manufactured by Schrade Cutlery Company. These knives, known for their ruggedness, affordability, and classic designs, were incredibly popular in the mid-20th century, particularly with outdoorsmen and working individuals. What makes them collectible is a combination of factors:\n\n*   **Nostalgia:** Many people associate Old Timers with their fathers or grandfathers, creating a sentimental value beyond their monetary worth.\n*   **Quality Construction:** While not high-end, Old Timers were generally well-made for their price point, using decent steel and sturdy construction.\n*   **Variety:** Schrade produced a wide range of Old Timer models, sizes, and handle materials, offering collectors a broad spectrum to choose from.\n*   **Availability (and Scarcity):** While many Old Timers were made, certain models, variations, and those in excellent condition are becoming increasingly scarce, driving up their value.\n*   **Brand Recognition:** The Old Timer brand is widely recognized, making it easier to buy, sell, and trade these knives.\n\nThe closure of Schrade in 2004 further fueled collector interest, as it marked the end of an era for American-made Old Timer knives. While Taylor Brands acquired the Schrade name and continues to produce Old Timer knives, collectors generally prioritize vintage examples made by Schrade.\n\n**2. How can I identify a genuine vintage Old Timer pocket knife?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying a genuine vintage Old Timer requires careful observation. Here are some key indicators:\n\n*   **Tang Stamps:** The tang stamp (the marking on the base of the blade) is crucial. Look for \"Schrade Walden\" or \"Schrade USA\" stamps. \"Schrade+\" indicates a later stainless steel version. Pay attention to the font and any variations, as counterfeiters often make mistakes. You can find resources online that detail the different Schrade tang stamps and their corresponding years of production.\n*   **Handle Material:** Old Timers typically used Staglon, a synthetic stag material that closely resembles real stag. Check for consistent color and texture. Real stag will have more variation.\n*   **Construction Quality:** Examine the fit and finish. While Old Timers weren't perfect, look for solid construction, properly aligned blades, and minimal gaps. Counterfeits often have noticeably poor construction.\n*   **Model Number:** Each Old Timer model has a specific number stamped on the blade or bolsters. Research the model number to verify its characteristics and features.\n*   **Sheath:** If the knife comes with a sheath, examine it carefully. Original sheaths will have the Old Timer logo and will be made of high-quality leather or nylon.\n*   **Packaging:** If available, the original box or packaging can be helpful in authenticating the knife. Look for consistent branding and model information.\n*   **Blade Steel:** Most vintage Old Timers use carbon steel blades, which will tarnish over time. Stainless steel blades are a later addition.\n\nConsult online resources, such as blade forums and collector websites, for detailed information and comparisons of genuine and counterfeit Old Timer knives.\n\n**3. What factors influence the value of an Old Timer pocket knife?**\n\n**Answer:** Several factors determine the value of an Old Timer pocket knife:\n\n*   **Condition:** Condition is paramount. A knife in mint, unused condition (often referred to as \"NIB\" - New in Box) will be worth significantly more than a used or damaged one. Look for scratches, rust, broken blades, and handle damage.\n*   **Rarity:** Certain models, limited editions, or those with unique features are rarer and thus more valuable. Research the specific model to determine its rarity.\n*   **Model:** Some models are more desirable than others. Larger stockman patterns or those with specific blade configurations tend to be more sought after.\n*   **Age:** Older Old Timers, especially those from the \"Schrade Walden\" era, often command higher prices.\n*   **Tang Stamp:** As mentioned earlier, the tang stamp can indicate the age and origin of the knife, impacting its value.\n*   **Original Packaging and Paperwork:** Having the original box, paperwork, and sheath can significantly increase the value.\n*   **Handle Material:** Staglon is common, but variations in color or limited edition handle materials can add to the value.\n*   **Location:** Market demand can vary regionally.\n*   **Provenance:** If the knife has a documented history or belonged to a notable individual, it can increase its value.\n\nUltimately, the value is determined by what a buyer is willing to pay. Consulting online auction sites like eBay (checking completed listings) and dedicated knife collecting forums is a good way to gauge current market prices.\n\n**4. Where can I find price guides or resources to help me estimate the value of my Old Timer pocket knife?**\n\n**Answer:** While there isn't a single definitive price guide for Old Timer knives, several resources can help you estimate their value:\n\n*   **eBay Completed Listings:** Searching eBay for completed listings of similar Old Timer models in comparable condition is a great way to see what they've recently sold for. Be sure to filter by \"Sold Items\" to see actual selling prices, not just asking prices.\n*   **Knife Collecting Forums:** Online knife collecting forums are invaluable resources. Members often discuss values, share information, and can help identify specific models. Examples include BladeForums and All About Pocket Knives (AAPK).\n*   **Knife Collecting Books:** While not always up-to-date, knife collecting books can provide historical context and general pricing guidelines. Look for books specifically focused on pocket knives or Schrade knives.\n*   **Knife Dealers and Appraisers:** Consider consulting with a reputable knife dealer or appraiser. They can provide a professional assessment of your knife's value, but be aware that they may charge a fee for their services.\n*   **Online Auction Houses:** Auction houses specializing in knives and collectibles often feature Old Timer knives. Reviewing their past auctions can provide valuable pricing information.\n*   **Social Media Groups:** Facebook groups dedicated to knife collecting can be a helpful source of information and informal appraisals.\n\nRemember that price guides are just estimates. The actual value of your Old Timer knife may vary depending on the specific factors mentioned in the previous answer.\n\n**5. Are all Old Timer pocket knives valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** No, not all Old Timer pocket knives are valuable. While the brand enjoys a strong following, many common models in average condition have limited monetary value. The value depends heavily on the factors outlined earlier, particularly condition, rarity, and model.\n\n*   **Common Models:** Mass-produced models like the 34OT Middleman or the 108OT Senior are generally less valuable than rarer or more desirable models.\n*   **Poor Condition:** Knives with significant damage, rust, or missing parts will have minimal value.\n*   **Post-2004 Production:** Old Timer knives produced after Schrade's closure in 2004 by Taylor Brands are generally less valuable than vintage Schrade-made examples.\n\nHowever, even common Old Timer knives can have sentimental value. If you inherited a knife from a family member, its emotional worth may far exceed its monetary value. It's also worth noting that even common knives in pristine condition can fetch a decent price from collectors looking to complete their sets.\n\n**6. I found an Old Timer pocket knife in an old box. How should I properly clean and care for it to maintain its value?**\n\n**Answer:** Cleaning and caring for an Old Timer pocket knife requires a delicate approach to preserve its value:\n\n*   **Gentle Cleaning:** Start with a soft cloth to remove loose dirt and debris. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the finish.\n*   **Rust Removal (If Necessary):** For light surface rust, use a specialized rust remover designed for knives or firearms. Apply it sparingly and follow the manufacturer's instructions. A very fine steel wool (0000 grade) with oil can also work, but use extreme caution.\n*   **Blade Lubrication:** Apply a thin coat of mineral oil or a specialized knife oil to the blades to prevent rust and ensure smooth operation.\n*   **Handle Care:** Clean the handle with a mild soap and water solution. Avoid soaking the handle in water, as this can damage the material. Dry thoroughly.\n*   **Sharpening (If Necessary):** If the blade is dull, consider having it professionally sharpened. Improper sharpening can damage the blade and reduce its value. If you choose to sharpen it yourself, use a high-quality sharpening system and practice on a less valuable knife first.\n*   **Storage:** Store the knife in a dry, safe place. A knife roll or case can help protect it from scratches and damage.\n\n**Important:** Avoid completely disassembling the knife unless you are experienced in knife repair. Disassembly can damage the knife and potentially void any value. Also, avoid polishing the blade excessively, as this can remove the original finish and reduce its value to collectors.\n\n**7. Where can I buy and sell Old Timer pocket knives?**\n\n**Answer:** There are several avenues for buying and selling Old Timer pocket knives:\n\n*   **Online Auction Sites (eBay):** eBay is a popular platform for buying and selling Old Timer knives. Be sure to research the seller's reputation and carefully examine the photos and descriptions before bidding or buying.\n*   **Knife Collecting Forums:** Many knife collecting forums have classifieds sections where members can buy, sell, and trade knives. This can be a good way to find specific models or connect with other collectors.\n*   **Knife Shows:** Attending knife shows is a great way to see a wide variety of Old Timer knives and meet other collectors and dealers.\n*   **Antique Stores and Flea Markets:** You might find Old Timer knives at antique stores and flea markets, but be sure to do your research and know what you're looking for before making a purchase.\n*   **Online Knife Retailers:** Some online knife retailers specialize in vintage and collectible knives, including Old Timers.\n*   **Pawn Shops:** Pawn shops may occasionally have Old Timer knives, but be cautious and do your research before buying.\n\nWhen selling an Old Timer knife, be sure to provide accurate descriptions, clear photos, and honest assessments of its condition. Transparency and good communication are key to a successful transaction. Remember to follow all applicable laws and regulations regarding the sale of knives in your area.\n",
