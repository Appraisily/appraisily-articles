Okay, I need to tackle this query about the value of antique picnic baskets. Let me start by understanding each part of the user's request. They want a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects. Let me go through each point one by one, using the provided search results to gather information.

First, defining what antique picnic basket value is and why it's important. From the sources, especially [4] and [9], I see that value comes from factors like age, craftsmanship, materials, and historical significance. The importance lies in their cultural and functional heritage, as well as their collectibility.

Next, historical background. Source [2] gives a good timeline, starting from Medieval Europe to their popularity in America. The evolution from aristocratic use to mainstream, and the role of materials like wicker and rattan. Also, the mention of pop culture in the 20th century adds context.

Types and variations: The search results list various types, like French Provincial, Chinese wedding baskets, Mid-Century Modern rattan, and others. Each has distinct materials and designs. For example, [1] mentions Chinese Wedding baskets from the 19th century and Mid-Century Austrian rattan baskets. Also, [14] talks about different styles like tote, cooler, and bamboo baskets.

Determining factors: From [4] and [9], key factors are construction quality (tight weaving, no nails), materials (rattan, bamboo), handles (carved vs. fitted), and condition. Paint and oxidation also affect value. For example, painted baskets with red or white are more sought after.

Identifying authenticity: Source [4] emphasizes checking for handmade imperfections, oxidation, and natural materials. Machine-made baskets might have uniformity and modern fasteners. The presence of maker's marks or provenance, like the Peterboro basket in [11], adds authenticity.

Market trends and pricing: Looking at [1], prices range from $20 to over $400. Auctions like [12] show sets going for specific bids. Etsy listings in [3] and [8] indicate a range from $20 to $95. The PBS appraisal in [15] shows values increasing over time, from $150-$250 to $400-$750.

Where to buy/sell: Online platforms like Etsy [3], Chairish [13], 1stDibs [1], and auctions [12]. Also, specialty stores like AmishBaskets.com [16] and local antique shops.

Care and maintenance: Source [7] provides detailed steps on cleaning with mild soap and avoiding moisture. Storing in dry places and using protective covers. Avoiding direct sunlight to prevent fading.

I need to structure all this into sections with headings, using specific examples. Make sure to cite sources properly. For instance, when talking about materials, cite [1] and [4]. When discussing market prices, reference [1], [3], [8], [12], [15]. For care tips, use [7].

Also, check for any conflicting information. For example, some baskets are priced higher due to provenance or unique features. Make sure to highlight that value can vary based on these factors. Use case studies like the Landers, Frary & Clark basket from [15] to illustrate appraisal changes over time.

Ensure each section flows logically, starting with definitions, moving through history, types, factors, identification, market trends, buying/selling, and care. Use tables where comparisons are needed, like in factors affecting value. Avoid using markdown in the thinking process but follow the user's format rules for the final answer.

Double-check that all information is from the provided sources and cited correctly. Avoid adding external knowledge. Make sure examples are specific, like the Chinese Wedding baskets from [1] or the Peterboro basket in [11]. Mention the role of platforms like Etsy and Chairish in the current market.

Finally, ensure the conclusion summarizes key points and emphasizes the multifaceted nature of antique picnic basket value, tying together historical, aesthetic, and market aspects.
