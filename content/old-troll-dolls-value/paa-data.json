What makes an old troll doll valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** Value in old troll dolls is determined by a combination of factors, making assessment more complex than simply age. Rarity is paramount. Troll dolls produced in limited quantities or for specific events (like promotional dolls for companies) are highly sought after. Condition is critical; pristine dolls with original clothing, hair, and tags command higher prices. Unique features, such as unusual hair colors (neon pink, metallic gold), glass eyes (instead of plastic), or distinctive body markings (like artist signatures or company logos), also increase value.\n\n*   **Material:** Early troll dolls made of wood or composition materials are rarer and generally more valuable than later plastic versions.\n*   **Size:** Larger troll dolls (over 12 inches) tend to be more valuable than smaller ones, especially if they are in good condition.\n*   **Brand:** While Thomas Dam's trolls are the most well-known, other manufacturers produced trolls. Some of these less-known brands can be valuable due to their scarcity.\n*   **Clothing:** Original clothing in good condition is a significant factor. Handmade or elaborate outfits add value.\n*   **Provenance:** If you have documentation showing the doll's history or ownership, it can significantly increase its value to collectors.\n\nUltimately, value is determined by what a collector is willing to pay. Researching recent sales of similar dolls on eBay, dedicated troll doll collector forums, and through auction houses is essential to gauge current market prices.\n\n**2. How can I identify a genuine Dam troll doll?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying a genuine Dam troll doll often involves looking for specific markings and characteristics associated with the original creator, Thomas Dam. These trolls, produced by Dam Things Establishment in Denmark, are highly prized by collectors.\n\n*   **Foot Markings:** Most genuine Dam trolls have \"DAM\" or \"DAM Things\" stamped on their feet. The absence of this marking is a strong indication it's not an original. Sometimes, these markings are faint or worn, so use a magnifying glass.\n*   **Hair:** Dam trolls typically have high-quality, often vibrant, hair. While hair color varies, the quality of the hair is a key indicator. Look for hair that is rooted well and hasn't been excessively cut or damaged.\n*   **Body Material:** Early Dam trolls were made of wood shavings (sawdust) mixed with other materials, giving them a slightly heavier feel and a more porous texture. Later versions were made of vinyl or plastic.\n*   **Eyes:** Dam trolls frequently have glass eyes, especially the older models. Later versions often used plastic eyes. The presence of glass eyes is a good sign of an older, potentially more valuable Dam troll.\n*   **Clothing and Tags:** Original Dam troll clothing is often well-made and may include a sewn-in tag with the Dam Things logo. However, clothing can be easily replaced, so this isn't the sole indicator.\n*   **Facial Features:** Dam trolls have a distinct facial expression and shape. Compare your troll to images of known Dam trolls to identify any inconsistencies.\n\nBeware of reproductions and imitations. Thorough research and comparison with known authentic examples are vital.\n\n**3. What is the average price range for vintage troll dolls?**\n\n**Answer:** The price range for vintage troll dolls is extremely broad, spanning from a few dollars to hundreds or even thousands of dollars, depending on the factors mentioned earlier (rarity, condition, brand, etc.).\n\n*   **Common Trolls:** Mass-produced plastic troll dolls from the 1960s and 1970s in average condition typically sell for $5 to $20. These are often found at flea markets and antique stores.\n*   **Dam Trolls:** Genuine Dam trolls, depending on their size, condition, and rarity, can range from $20 to several hundred dollars. Larger, well-preserved examples, especially those with original clothing and tags, command higher prices.\n*   **Rare or Limited Edition Trolls:** Extremely rare or limited-edition troll dolls, such as those produced for specific events or with unique features (like glass eyes, unusual hair colors, or artist signatures), can sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars. A very rare 1960s Dam troll could fetch prices in the $500-$2000 range, or even higher if in mint condition and with documented provenance.\n*   **Specialty Trolls:** Troll dolls with unique outfits, such as those representing professions or hobbies, or those with special features like glow-in-the-dark hair, can also be more valuable.\n\nResearching recent sales on online marketplaces like eBay and consulting with troll doll collectors or appraisers is crucial for determining the current market value of your specific doll.\n\n**4. Are troll dolls with glass eyes more valuable than those with plastic eyes?**\n\n**Answer:** Generally, troll dolls with glass eyes are considered more valuable than those with plastic eyes. This is because glass eyes are typically found on older, earlier-produced troll dolls, particularly those made by Thomas Dam. The presence of glass eyes is often an indicator of a higher-quality, more collectible troll.\n\n*   **Historical Context:** Glass eyes were used in the earliest Dam troll dolls, reflecting the manufacturing techniques and materials available at the time. As production methods evolved and plastic became more prevalent, plastic eyes became the norm.\n*   **Rarity:** Because glass-eyed trolls are older, they are often rarer than plastic-eyed trolls, especially in good condition. This scarcity contributes to their higher value.\n*   **Aesthetics:** Many collectors prefer the look of glass eyes, finding them more realistic and appealing than plastic eyes. This aesthetic preference further drives up the demand and, consequently, the price.\n*   **Exceptions:** While glass eyes generally increase value, the overall condition of the doll, its size, rarity, and other unique features are still important factors. A damaged glass-eyed troll might be worth less than a pristine plastic-eyed troll with a rare feature.\n\nTherefore, while glass eyes are a positive indicator of potential value, a thorough assessment of all factors is necessary.\n\n**5. Where can I find information about old troll doll values and rarity?**\n\n**Answer:** Finding reliable information about old troll doll values and rarity requires a multi-pronged approach. Here are several resources to consider:\n\n*   **Online Marketplaces (eBay, Etsy):** Search for \"vintage troll doll\" and filter by \"sold items\" to see what similar dolls have recently sold for.

Understanding these issues can help collectors avoid costly mistakes and maintain their collections effectively.\n\n*   **Fakes and Reproductions:** The market is flooded with fake and reproduction troll dolls, especially of the more valuable Dam trolls.

Gentle brushing with a soft brush and storing dolls away from direct sunlight can help preserve their hair.\n*   **Clothing Damage:** Original troll doll clothing can be fragile and susceptible to damage from moths, mildew, and discoloration. Storing clothing separately or in acid-free tissue paper can help prevent deterioration.\n*   **Storage Space:** As collections grow, storage space becomes a significant concern.

Where is the best place to buy or sell old troll dolls?**\n\n**Answer:** The best place to buy or sell old troll dolls depends on your goals and the type of dolls you're dealing with. Here's a breakdown of options:\n\n*   **eBay:** eBay is a popular platform for buying and selling troll dolls, offering a wide selection and competitive prices.
