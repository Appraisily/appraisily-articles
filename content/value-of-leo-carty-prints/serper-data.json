      "question": "How do I know if my print is valuable?",

The collectability of a print for example, will increase if the image is desirable, the artist is acclaimed or the edition length is limited. If a print run is small, then a print's value is enhanced by its relative rarity.",

For example, a print with torn edges is likely to hold less value than a pristine art print.",
