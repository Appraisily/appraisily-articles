Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on the value of old Bulova watches. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to ensure I cover everything thoroughly. 

First, understanding what old Bulova watches' value means. From the search results, I see that most vintage Bulova watches aren't extremely valuable, but certain models can fetch thousands. The importance comes from their historical significance, craftsmanship, and collectibility. I should mention examples like celebrity-owned pieces and limited editions.

Next, the historical background. Bulova was founded in 1875, and their innovations like the Accutron and military contributions during WWII are key points. The 1919 line of men's wristwatches and the 1960s Accutron technology are milestones. I need to highlight these developments and how they impacted the brand's reputation and watch values.

For types and variations, the search results mention Art Deco models, Accutron, military Hack watches, and limited editions like the "Stars and Stripes." I should categorize these and provide specific examples with sales data, like the Elvis Presley Accutron selling for $17k.

Determining factors include rarity, condition, materials, provenance, and movement type. The user provided sources mention that gold and diamond models are more valuable, and original parts are crucial. I need to explain each factor with examples, maybe comparing a standard model versus a rare one.

Authenticity identification tips are covered in source [3], which details signatures on dials, movements, and cases. I should outline the steps to verify authenticity, like checking for "Bulova" markings and avoiding dials that say "Movement."

Market trends from sources [4] and [10] note that demand fluctuates, but certain models like Accutrons or space-related watches are trending. Recent sales data from [1] shows celebrity-owned watches fetching high prices. I should include current price ranges for different categories.

Buying and selling venues include auction houses, online platforms like eBay, and specialized dealers. Source [5] mentions 1stDibs, and [11] talks about repair services affecting resale value. I'll list trusted places and tips for sellers, like getting appraisals.

Maintenance tips from [6] and [11] suggest regular servicing every 3-5 years, proper cleaning, and avoiding magnets. Storing in a dry place and using professionals for repairs are important. I should structure these tips clearly, maybe in bullet points for readability.

I need to ensure each section is well-organized with headers, cites relevant sources, and includes specific examples. Let me cross-reference the sources to make sure I'm not missing any key points. Also, check that all eight user points are addressed comprehensively without overlapping sections. Finally, maintain an expert tone with clear, structured Markdown formatting as per the guidelines.

The value of vintage Bulova watches stems from their historical significance, craftsmanship, and cultural impact. While most models range from $20–$100, rare examples tied to celebrities, military history, or technical innovation can command $3,000–$30,000 at auction[1][4][14]. Below is a structured analysis of key factors influencing their worth.

## 1. Defining Old Bulova Watches’ Value  
Vintage Bulova watches (pre-1980) derive value from:  
- **Historical milestones**: First fully electronic watch (Accutron, 1960), WWII military-issued "Hack" models[14], and NASA space mission timers[8].  
- **Cultural connections**: Celebrity-owned pieces (e.g., Elvis Presley’s $17,920 Accutron)[1].  
- **Technical innovation**: Tuning fork movements (Accutron) and early quartz technology[12].  

Importance lies in their role as accessible luxury items that democratized precision timekeeping while pioneering marketing strategies like radio/TV ads[8].

## 2. Historical Development  
- **1875**: Joseph Bulova opens NYC jewelry store, later shifting to watchmaking[12].  
- **1919**: First complete men’s wristwatch line, capitalizing on post-WWI demand[2].  
- **1940s**: Produces 4+ million watches for U.S. troops, introducing synchronized “hacking” seconds[14].  
- **1960**: Accutron debuts with 360Hz tuning fork accuracy (±2 sec/day), later used in NASA missions[8][12].  
- **1970s**: Discontinued collectibles like the “Stars and Stripes” Chronograph C ($3,600 modern auction)[1].

## 4. Value Determinants  
- **Rarity**: Discontinued models (e.g., 1971 “Stars and Stripes”) appreciate due to scarcity[1].  
- **Materials**: 14K/18K gold or diamond-bezel models (e.g., $999 eBay sale)[1] vs. base-metal counterparts ($20–$50).  
- **Condition**: Unpolished cases with original dials fetch 30–50% premiums[10].  
- **Provenance**: Documentation linking watches to figures like Joe DiMaggio (+$31,250 auction premium)[1].  
- **Movement**: Accutron tuning fork models outvalue standard mechanical/quartz[12].  

---

## 5. Authenticity Verification  
- **Dial**: Must read “Bulova” or “Accutron”; avoid “Movement” subtext (indicates non-Bulova case/dial)[3].  
- **Movement**: Pre-1923: “Bulova W. Co.”; post-1923: “Bulova Watch Co”[3].  
- **Case Codes**: Post-1950 alphanumeric stamps (e.g., M9 = 1969)[5].  
- **Red Flags**: Mismatched fonts, non-period-correct lume, or replacement hands[3].  

---

## 6. Market Trends (2023–2025)  
- **Rising Demand**: Military reissues (+20% since 2020) and Accutron Spaceview models[9][14].  
- **Declining Interest**: 1980s quartz models without historical ties[4].  
- **Auction Highlights**:  
  - Les Paul’s Bulova: $25,600 (2023)[1]  
  - NOS 1960s Accutrons: $1,200–$2,800[7]  

---

## 7. Acquisition & Sales Channels  
- **Buying**:  
  - Auction houses (Julien’s, Christie’s) for high-provenance pieces[1].  
  - Specialized dealers (Watchophilia, 1stDibs) for vetted models[5][13].  
- **Selling**:  
  - eBay for sub-$1,000 watches (1.5M+ monthly searches for “vintage Bulova”)[1].  
  - Professional appraisal recommended for rare models to avoid undervaluation[10].  

---

## 8. Preservation Guidelines  
- **Servicing**: Mechanical movements every 3–5 years; quartz during battery changes[6][11].  
- **Storage**: Silica gel containers to prevent moisture damage; avoid magnets near Accutrons[6].  
- **Cleaning**: Use microfiber cloths; avoid solvents on acrylic crystals[6].  
- **Restoration**: Only original Bulova parts (e.g., Accutron 214 coils) to retain value[11].

This guide synthesizes Bulova’s technical legacy and collectibility, emphasizing due diligence in authentication and market research. While most models remain affordable, targeted acquisitions of historically significant pieces offer both financial and horological rewards.
