What makes a duck decoy \"most wanted\" by collectors?**\n\n**Answer:** The \"most wanted\" antique duck decoys are typically those that possess a unique combination of factors contributing to their rarity, historical significance, and artistic merit. It's not just about age; many old decoys exist, but only a select few command top dollar. Key factors include:\n\n*   **Carver's Reputation:** Decoys carved by renowned artisans like Elmer Crowell, Charles Perdew, or the Mason Decoy Factory are highly sought after. Their skill and artistry translate into higher prices.\n*   **Rarity:** Limited production runs, unique species representation (e.g., a rare pintail hen), or experimental designs all contribute to rarity. A decoy might be rare due to a specific wood type used or a unique paint pattern.\n*   **Condition:** Original paint in excellent condition significantly increases value. Repainted decoys are less desirable, though a sympathetic restoration by a qualified professional can sometimes mitigate the loss.\n*   **Provenance:** A documented history of ownership, especially if it includes notable collectors or hunters, adds to the decoy's allure.\n*   **Form and Detail:** Decoys exhibiting exceptional craftsmanship, realistic anatomy, and intricate detailing are generally more desirable.\n*   **Historical Context:** Decoys connected to significant hunting lodges, historical events, or specific regions can also be highly valued. For example, a decoy used at a famous hunting club in the Chesapeake Bay would be more valuable than a similar one with no known history.\n\nUltimately, the \"most wanted\" decoys are those that represent the pinnacle of the decoy carver's art and embody a significant piece of waterfowl hunting history.\n\n**2. How can I identify an antique duck decoy and distinguish it from a modern reproduction?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying an antique duck decoy requires careful observation and research. Here are some key steps to differentiate an original from a modern reproduction:\n\n*   **Examine the Wood:** Antique decoys often show signs of age, such as weathering, checking (small cracks in the wood), and wear patterns consistent with use. Modern reproductions often appear too \"clean.\" Look for evidence of hand carving, tool marks, and the type of wood used, which can often be identified through close examination.\n*   **Analyze the Paint:** Original paint typically exhibits age-related wear, including crazing (fine cracks in the paint), chipping, and fading. Modern paint often looks too vibrant and uniform. Use a magnifying glass to examine the paint layers; multiple layers of original paint are a good sign.\n*   **Check the Eyes:** Antique decoy eyes are often made of glass, tack eyes, or painted directly onto the decoy. Modern reproductions may use plastic eyes or other synthetic materials.\n*   **Look for Maker's Marks:** Some carvers stamped their decoys with their initials, names, or the name of their decoy company. These marks can be invaluable for identification. The Mason Decoy Factory, for example, is well-known for their identifying marks.\n*   **Assess the Weight and Feel:** Antique decoys are often heavier than modern reproductions due to the use of denser wood and the accumulation of paint. They also have a certain \"feel\" that comes with age and use.\n*   **Research the Carver and Style:** Familiarize yourself with the characteristics of different carvers and regional styles. This will help you identify potential fakes and determine the authenticity of a decoy. Reference books and online resources are invaluable for this.\n*   **Consult an Expert:** If you're unsure, seek the opinion of a reputable decoy appraiser or dealer.\n\n**3. What are some of the most valuable antique duck decoy carvers and why?**\n\n**Answer:** Several carvers consistently command high prices in the antique duck decoy market. Here are a few of the most highly regarded:\n\n*   **Elmer Crowell (East Harwich, Massachusetts):** Known for his exceptional detail and realistic painting, particularly on his decorative carvings. His preening black duck and other high-grade decoys can fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n*   **Charles Perdew (Henry, Illinois):** A master carver from the Illinois River Valley, Perdew's decoys are prized for their sturdy construction, functional design, and folk-art charm. His canvasback drakes are especially sought after.\n*   **A. Elmer Crowell (East Harwich, Massachusetts):** While sometimes confused with his father, A. Elmer Crowell also produced highly desirable decoys. He is known for his miniature carvings and intricate detail.\n*   **Nathan Cobb Jr. (Cobb Island, Virginia):** Cobb's decoys are known for their simple elegance and functional design. His canvasback decoys are particularly desirable.\n*   **Mason Decoy Factory (Detroit, Michigan):** While not a single carver, the Mason Decoy Factory produced a large quantity of high-quality decoys. Their \"Premier Grade\" decoys are among the most valuable.\n*   **Ira Hudson (Chincoteague, Virginia):** Hudson's decoys are characterized by their distinctive paint patterns and folk-art style.\n\nThe value of these carvers' work stems from their skill, artistry, and the rarity of their decoys.

What factors are considered?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the value of an antique duck decoy is a complex process involving several key factors. A professional appraisal is often recommended, but here's a breakdown of the considerations:\n\n*   **Carver/Maker:** As mentioned earlier, decoys by renowned carvers like Crowell or Perdew command higher prices.\n*   **Species:** Some species are rarer or more desirable than others.

The less wear and tear, the higher the value. Repainted decoys are worth significantly less.\n*   **Rarity:** The fewer examples of a particular decoy known to exist, the more valuable it is. This can be due to limited production runs, experimental designs, or the destruction of a carver's work.\n*   **Provenance:** A documented history of ownership adds value, especially if it includes notable collectors or historical figures.\n*   **Form and Detail:** Decoys with exceptional craftsmanship, realistic anatomy, and intricate detailing are more desirable.\n*   **Region:** Certain regional styles are more sought after than others. For example, Chesapeake Bay decoys are highly regarded.\n*   **Market Demand:** The current market demand for a particular type of decoy can fluctuate based on trends and collector preferences.\n*   **Presence of Original Features:** Original weights, rigging, and glass eyes all add value.\n\nAppraisers typically use a combination of these factors, along with comparable sales data from auctions and private transactions, to determine the fair market value of a decoy.\n\n**5.

Examples include Copley Fine Art Auctions and Guyette & Deeter.\n*   **Decoy Shows and Events:** These events bring together collectors, dealers, and carvers, providing opportunities to buy, sell, and learn about decoys.\n*   **Online Marketplaces:** Websites like eBay, LiveAuctioneers, and specialized decoy marketplaces can offer a wide selection of decoys, but caution is advised due to the risk of fakes.\n*   **Antique Dealers:** Reputable antique dealers specializing in folk art or sporting collectibles can provide expert advice and authentic decoys.\n*   **Private Sales:** Direct purchases from other collectors or individuals can sometimes offer good deals, but due diligence is essential.\n*   **Consignment:** Consigning your decoys to a reputable auction house or dealer can be a good way to reach a wider audience and maximize your return.\n\nWhen buying or selling decoys, it's crucial to do your research, ask questions, and seek expert advice when needed.\n\n**7.
