Okay, I need to help the user with their research on old bottle identification marks. Let me start by understanding exactly what they're asking for. They want a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects, so I need to make sure each section is addressed thoroughly.

First, I'll look at the search results provided. The main sources are from True Legacy Homes, the Society for Historical Archaeology, Glass Bottle Marks, LoveToKnow, and others. These sources discuss how to identify old bottles through marks like embossing, pontil marks, mold seams, and manufacturer logos. 

For the first section, defining what old bottle identification marks are, I can explain that these marks include embossed letters, numbers, logos, and manufacturing traces like pontil marks. Their importance lies in determining age, origin, and authenticity, which affects value. Sources [1], [7], and [17] mention how marks help in dating bottles and identifying manufacturers.

Next, the historical background. The SHA source [2] talks about marks from the 19th century onwards, noting that early bottles had pontil marks before machine production. The transition from hand-blown to machine-made bottles in the late 1800s changed the types of marks, as mentioned in [1] and [18]. I should outline this evolution, maybe using examples like Owens-Illinois marks from the 1920s [2].

Types of marks would include embossed trademarks, mold numbers, pontil marks, and color variations. Sources [1], [3], and [8] provide examples like the Owens-Illinois diamond mark or the "A" mark from British soda bottles. Categorizing these into manufacturer marks, production marks, etc., would structure this section.

Determining value factors: Rarity, condition, historical significance. LoveToKnow [4] and Antique Trader [7] mention that pontil marks and rare logos increase value. The price list in [10] and examples in [13] show specific valuations, like the Pacific Glass Works bottle worth $2,200.

Identifying authenticity involves checking for mold seams, pontil marks, and inconsistencies. Sources [1] and [4] warn about reproductions with pre-1850 dates or bold colors. The SHA database [1] is a key resource for verifying marks.

Market trends: The bottles market report [5] indicates growth in sustainable packaging, but antique bottles have their niche. eBay and 1stDibs [9], [15] are mentioned as platforms, with prices ranging widely. The Downeast Digger [14] notes that eBay has affected prices, making some bottles more affordable but rare ones still expensive.

Where to buy/sell: Online platforms like eBay, 1stDibs, and specialized sites like Bob's BottleMania [16]. Auctions and antique shows are also venues. Examples from [11] and [15] show listings and price ranges.

Care and maintenance: Gentle cleaning with mild soap, avoiding harsh chemicals, and proper storage. Sources [6] and [17] recommend using distilled water and soft cloths, not dishwashers. Handling tips from [6] include padding surfaces to prevent chipping.

I need to organize all this into sections with headers, cite sources appropriately, and include examples like specific marks and prices. Make sure each section answers the user's query points, using the provided search results for accuracy. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer should follow the specified format with headers and citations.

Determining the age and origin of antique glass bottles relies heavily on analyzing their identification marks. These marks – including embossed symbols, mold numbers, and manufacturing traces – serve as historical fingerprints that reveal a bottle’s provenance, production era, and cultural context. Below is a comprehensive analysis of this specialized field.

---

### 1. **What Are Old Bottle Identification Marks?**  
Old bottle identification marks are physical characteristics or symbols intentionally or unintentionally left during manufacturing. They include:  
- **Embossed trademarks/logos** (e.g., Owens-Illinois’ diamond mark [2])  
- **Mold numbers** (e.g., “20” indicating an Oakland, CA plant [2])  
- **Pontil marks** (rough scars from iron rods used in pre-1860s hand-blown bottles [1][18])  
- **Seam lines** (indicative of machine production post-1905 [1][17])  

These marks are critical for:  
- Dating bottles within a 20–30 year range [2]  
- Identifying manufacturers (e.g., Pacific Glass Works’ star mark [4])  
- Authenticating rare specimens (e.g., pontil-marked bottles from the 1850s [10])  

---

### 2. **Historical Development**  
- **Pre-1850s**: Hand-blown bottles with pontil marks dominated. Marks were rare except for crude initials (e.g., “C.C.G.C.” on Wisconsin beer bottles [2]).  
- **Late 19th century**: Mold embossing emerged, allowing logos like “Albany Glass Works” (1847–1851) [3].  
- **Early 20th century**: Machine-made bottles introduced standardized marks (e.g., Owens-Illinois’ plant codes [2]).  
- **Post-1930s**: Reproductions began mimicking antique marks, requiring advanced verification [1].

### 3. **Types of Marks**  
| **Category**         | **Examples**                                                                 |  
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Manufacturer Marks** | “AB&Co” on British blackglass bottles (1860s) [3], “AGW” for Adolphus Glass Works [17] |  
| **Date Codes**         | “1” = 1941 production year in Owens-Illinois marks [2]                     |  
| **Mold Numbers**       | Single/double digits indicating mold sections (e.g., “No 1” [2])           |  
| **Pontil Marks**       | Open pontil (pre-1850), improved pontil (1850–1865) [18]                   |  
| **Color Codes**        | Amber for UV protection (medicines), green for beer/wine [4][17]           |

### 4. **Value Determinants**  
- **Rarity**: Only 15 known Pacific Glass Works star-marked bottles exist ($2,200+ [4]).  
- **Condition**: Chips or stains reduce value by 50–80% [10].  
- **Historical Significance**: Civil War-era “U.S. Army Hospital Department” bottles fetch $700+ [13].  
- **Mark Clarity**: Bold, legible embossing increases value (e.g., “Doc Stork Milk Bottle” at $2,300 [13]).  

---

### 5. **Authenticity Identification**  
- **Pontil Verification**: Authentic pre-1860 pontil marks are irregular, not machine-replicated [1].  
- **Seam Analysis**: Pre-1905 seams stop below the lip; post-1920 seams are hair-thin [1][17].  
- **Mark Consistency**: Repro marks often have anachronisms (e.g., “1835” dates paired with mold lines [4]).  
- **Database Cross-Reference**: The [Society for Historical Archaeology’s mark encyclopedia](https://sha.org/bottle/makersmarks.htm) is the gold standard [1][2].  

---

### 6. **Market Trends (2025)**  
- **Premium Pricing**: Pontil-marked bottles (pre-1860) average $950–$42,500 [9][15].  
- **Declining Mid-Tier**: Common 1900s bottles (e.g., milk bottles) now sell for $20–$100 due to eBay saturation [14].  
- **Niche Demand**: Whiskey flasks (e.g., “Red Stork” at $2,850 [10]) and poison bottles ($3,000 [10]) remain strong.  

---

### 7. **Acquisition & Sales Channels**  
- **Online Marketplaces**: eBay ([11]), 1stDibs ($145–$8,500 range [15]), and specialized sites like [Bob’s BottleMania](https://www.bobsbottlemania.com) [16].  
- **Auctions**: Rare bottles like the $6,700 “double eagle flask” surface at heritage auctions [10].  
- **Shows**: Bottle digger conventions often feature unverified “field finds” at negotiable prices [7].  

---

### 8. **Preservation Guidelines**  
- **Cleaning**: Use mild soap, lukewarm water, and bottle brushes – **never** dishwashers or high-pressure rinsing [6].  
- **Storage**: Keep in stable temperatures (avoid direct sunlight) with padded separation to prevent chips [6][17].  
- **Handling**: Wear cotton gloves to avoid oil transfer; support the base to reduce stress on fragile necks [6].

This field combines forensic analysis with historical research, requiring tools like UV lights (to detect reproductions) and magnification for mark verification. As sustainability trends boost interest in vintage glass [5], identification marks remain the linchpin for valuing these artifacts.
