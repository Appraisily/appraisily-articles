  "content": "**People Also Ask (value of old postcards)**\n\n**1. What makes a postcard valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** Several factors contribute to a postcard's value, and it's rarely a single element that makes it highly desirable. Scarcity is a primary driver; if few examples of a particular card exist, its value increases. This scarcity can stem from limited print runs, regional distribution, or specific historical events depicted. The condition of the postcard is also crucial. Mint or near-mint postcards, free from creases, tears, stains, or writing on the image side, command higher prices.\n\nSubject matter plays a significant role. Postcards depicting disasters (like the Titanic), famous people, rare or unusual modes of transportation (early aircraft), or specific events (world's fairs) are often sought after. Artist-signed postcards, especially those by well-known illustrators like Ellen Clapsaddle or Frances Brundage, can be quite valuable. Finally, the age of the postcard matters, but older doesn't always mean more valuable. A common 1900s postcard might be worth less than a rarer 1920s card. Consider the combination of age, condition, rarity, and subject matter when assessing value. Many collectors specialize in specific themes or eras, further influencing demand and pricing.\n\n**2. How can I identify the age of an old postcard?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the age of a postcard is the first step in assessing its potential value. Several clues can help you narrow down the timeframe.\n\n*   **Divided Backs:** Postcards with a divided back (a line down the middle allowing for both address and message) generally date from 1907 or later. Prior to this, the entire back was reserved for the address.\n*   **Undivided Backs:** These postcards, common before 1907, have the entire back dedicated to the recipient's address, forcing the sender to write their message on the front image.\n*   **Real Photo Postcards (RPPCs):** These are actual photographs printed onto postcard stock. The golden age of RPPCs was roughly 1900-1920. Often, the photographer's imprint or a developing paper brand name on the back can help pinpoint a more specific date range.\n*   **Postmark Dates:** Examine the postmark carefully. While the card may have been printed earlier, the postmark provides the date it was actually mailed.\n*   **Printing Techniques:** Chromolithography (a multi-stone printing process) was common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Later, halftone printing became more prevalent. The printing style can offer clues.\n*   **Paper Stock:** Early postcards often used thicker, heavier paper. Later postcards used thinner, less expensive stock.\n*   **Subject Matter:** Fashions, automobiles, and historical events depicted on the card can also provide clues to its age. Researching these details can help corroborate your findings.\n\n**3. What is the difference between a \"real photo postcard\" and a printed postcard?**\n\n**Answer:** The distinction between a real photo postcard (RPPC) and a printed postcard lies in the method of production. Printed postcards utilize various printing techniques, such as lithography or halftone, to reproduce an image onto postcard stock. These images are typically created from artwork, drawings, or photographs that are converted into a printable format.\n\nReal photo postcards, on the other hand, are actual photographs printed directly onto postcard-sized photographic paper. This process involves exposing photographic paper to light through a negative, resulting in a unique, one-of-a-kind image on the postcard. RPPCs often have a glossy or semi-glossy finish, and they may exhibit variations in tone and contrast due to the photographic printing process.\n\nThe key difference is that printed postcards are mass-produced reproductions, while RPPCs are essentially miniature photographs. RPPCs often offer a higher level of detail and a more authentic representation of the subject matter. Because they are often unique images, they can be highly sought after by collectors. Look for details like photographer's imprints or the brand of photographic paper on the back to identify them.\n\n**4. How can I determine the value of my old postcards?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the value of your old postcards requires a combination of research, observation, and sometimes, expert advice. Here's a breakdown of steps to take:\n\n*   **Identify the Card:** As mentioned earlier, determine the age, subject matter, and any artist or publisher information. The more details you have, the better.\n*   **Assess Condition:** Carefully examine the card for creases, tears, stains, writing, or damage. The condition significantly impacts value.\n*   **Research Comparable Sales:** Look for similar postcards on online auction sites like eBay (check completed listings to see what items *actually* sold for), specialized postcard dealer websites, and online databases. Pay attention to the condition of the cards and their selling prices.\n*   **Consult Price Guides:** While price guides can provide a general idea of value, they are often outdated and should be used as a starting point only.\n*   **Consider Rarity:** Is the card common or rare? Rare cards, especially those with unusual subjects or limited print runs, are generally worth more.\n*   **Get an Appraisal:** For potentially valuable or unusual postcards, consider seeking an appraisal from a reputable postcard dealer or appraiser. They can provide a more accurate assessment based on their expertise and market knowledge.\n*   **Factors Affecting Value:** Remember that demand fluctuates. What is popular today might not be tomorrow. The overall market for collectibles also influences prices.\n\n**5. Where can I buy and sell old postcards?**\n\n**Answer:** The market for old postcards is vibrant, with numerous avenues for both buying and selling.\n\n*   **Online Auction Sites:** eBay remains a popular platform for buying and selling postcards. However, be aware of fees and competition. Thoroughly research the seller/buyer reputation.\n*   **Postcard Shows and Fairs:** These events offer a great opportunity to browse a wide selection of postcards, meet dealers, and often find hidden gems. Search online for postcard shows in your area.\n*   **Antique Shops and Flea Markets:** While selection may be limited, you can sometimes find postcards at antique shops and flea markets, often at reasonable prices.\n*   **Specialized Postcard Dealers:** Many dealers specialize in postcards and have extensive inventories. They can be found online or at postcard shows.\n*   **Online Marketplaces (Etsy, Ruby Lane):** These platforms cater to vintage and collectible items and can be a good option for selling postcards, particularly if you have unique or high-quality items.\n*   **Estate Sales:** Keep an eye out for estate sales, as they can be a source of old postcards, often at bargain prices.\n*   **Libraries and Archives:** While not for buying or selling, libraries and archives may hold significant postcard collections that can be viewed by the public. This can be helpful for research and identification.\n\n**6. What are some common problems or challenges faced by postcard collectors?**\n\n**Answer:** Postcard collecting, while rewarding, presents several common challenges:\n\n*   **Storage:** Proper storage is crucial to prevent damage. Postcards should be stored in acid-free sleeves and albums or boxes to protect them from light, humidity, and physical damage.\n*   **Condition Issues:** Finding postcards in excellent condition can be difficult, especially for older or more popular cards. Damage significantly reduces value.\n*   **Fakes and Reproductions:** Be wary of reproductions and fakes, especially of rare or valuable cards. Research the publisher and printing techniques to help identify authentic cards.\n*   **Overpaying:** It's easy to overpay for postcards, especially when starting out. Research prices and compare similar cards before making a purchase.\n*   **Keeping Up with Market Trends:** The market for postcards can fluctuate, so it's important to stay informed about current trends and prices.\n*   **Identifying Rare Cards:** Accurately identifying rare or unusual cards requires research and knowledge. Consult with experts if you're unsure.\n*   **Fraudulent Sellers:** Be cautious of fraudulent sellers, especially online. Check seller feedback and reputation before making a purchase. Pay with secure methods like PayPal that offer buyer protection.\n\n**7. What are some popular themes or subjects that postcard collectors focus on?**\n\n**Answer:** Postcard collectors often specialize in specific themes or subjects, which adds depth and focus to their collections. Some popular themes include:\n\n*   **Greetings & Holidays:** Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and other holiday-themed postcards are highly sought after.\n*   **Transportation:** Trains, automobiles, ships, and airplanes are popular subjects.\n*   **Disasters:** Postcards depicting natural disasters, fires, or other significant events can be valuable historical records.\n*   **Architecture:** Buildings, landmarks, and cityscapes are common themes.\n*   **World's Fairs and Expositions:** These events generated a wealth of postcards, many of which are now highly collectible.\n*   **Political & Social Commentary:** Postcards reflecting political views, social issues, or historical events.\n*   **Artist-Signed Postcards:** Cards illustrated by well-known artists, such as Ellen Clapsaddle or Frances Brundage, are highly prized.\n*   **Animals:** Cats, dogs, and other animals are popular subjects.\n*   **Local Topography:** Many collectors focus on postcards depicting their hometown or region.\n*   **Linens:** Linen postcards, printed on textured linen paper in the 1930s-1950s, are a distinct category with their own dedicated collectors.\n\nThese are just a few examples; the possibilities are endless. Specializing allows collectors to develop expertise and build a more focused and valuable collection.\n",
