Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on identifying old sewing tools. Let me start by breaking down the user's query into the eight specified aspects. 

First, understanding what identifying old sewing tools entails and why it's important. From the search results, I see that antique tools like thimbles, scissors, and needle holders have historical and cultural value. They offer insights into past craftsmanship and daily life. The importance lies in preserving heritage and understanding the evolution of sewing technology.

Next, the historical background. The search results mention tools dating back thousands of years, like bone needles from Denisovan Cave. The development from bone to metal tools, especially in places like Redditch, England, which became famous for needle production. I should highlight key historical periods and technological advancements, such as the shift from handmade to machine-made tools.

For types and categories, the sources list various tools: thimbles, scissors, needle cases, bobbins, darning tools, and specialized items like tatting shuttles. Each category has sub-types, like spring vs. pivot scissors. Including examples from the search results, such as the hole punch for crocheted edges or the toothbrush needle for rag rugs, will add specificity.

Determining value factors: authenticity, materials, craftsmanship, and provenance. The LoveToKnow article mentions materials like ivory or ebony increasing value. Rarity and brand, like Singer sewing machines, also play a role. The MetMo UK source discusses how unaltered tools with original parts are more valuable. I should integrate these points, maybe using case studies from the provided search results.

Identifying authentic tools involves checking materials, wear patterns, and maker's marks. The LoveToKnow guide suggests looking for residue and wear, which indicate usage. For example, sawdust in a woodworking tool or oil in moving parts. Also, verifying hallmarks or stamps from known manufacturers like Charles Horner.

Market trends and pricing: The Ruby Lane listings show prices ranging from $24 to several thousand dollars, depending on the item. Singer machines are highlighted as collectible. The price guide from LoveToKnow mentions factors like age and brand, with 19th-century tools being more valuable. Current demand for vintage and handmade items in crafting communities might be a trend.

Where to buy/sell: Online marketplaces like Ruby Lane, Etsy, and specialized antique shops. Auction houses and estate sales are also sources. The Gatherings Antique Vintage is mentioned as a specialized dealer. Including these examples will provide practical info for readers.

Care and maintenance: Regular cleaning with soft brushes, proper lubrication, and safe storage away from moisture and sunlight. The Retro Sew Machines source emphasizes using gentle cleaning solutions and consulting manufacturer guidelines. For electric tools, checking cords and components is crucial.

I need to ensure each section flows naturally, avoiding lists and using paragraphs. Citations from the search results should be inline, using the provided indices. For example, mentioning the hole punch tool from source [1] or the materials discussion from [2]. 

I should also check that all eight aspects are covered thoroughly, using specific examples and data points from the sources. Making sure the structure follows the report format with headers and subsections. Avoiding any markdown in the thinking process, but keeping track of the structure for the final report.

Finally, verifying that the information is accurate and properly cited, and that the report meets the comprehensive and detailed requirements, aiming for around 10,000 words with deep dives into each section. Including case studies like the Redditch needle production or specific tools from the Ruby Lane listings will add depth. Ensuring the conclusion ties together the importance of preservation and the current market's reflection of historical value.
