Okay, so I need to write a comprehensive article about antique identification of glass bottle markings on the bottom. Let me start by breaking down the user's query into the eight points they mentioned. 

First, I need to define what these markings are and why they're important. From the search results, I see that markings on the bottom can be mold numbers, manufacturer logos, or other identifiers. They help in dating the bottle and determining its origin. The importance comes from their role in historical research and valuation, as mentioned in sources [1], [2], and [7].

Next, the historical background. The search results mention that early bottles had pontil marks, which were common before the mid-19th century. The development of mold numbers and manufacturer marks came later, especially with automation in the early 20th century. Sources like [8] and [10] discuss pontil marks and the transition to mold-made bottles.

For types of markings, the results talk about mold numbers, manufacturer trademarks, date codes, and pontil marks. Each type serves a different purpose. For example, mold numbers helped identify faulty molds [1], while trademarks like SF & PGW indicate the manufacturer [7]. I should categorize these based on the information from [1], [7], [10], and [12].

Determining value involves factors like rarity, condition, and historical significance. Sources [2], [4], and [7] mention that scarcity and manufacturer marks can increase value. For instance, the Pacific Glass Works bottle with a star mark is rare and valuable [7].

Identifying authentic markings requires checking for mold seams, pontil marks, and embossing quality. The presence of mold lines that go all the way to the lip indicates a more recent bottle [3], while pontil marks suggest an older, hand-blown piece [8], [10]. Also, the style of embossing and the presence of manufacturer logos are clues [1], [7].

Market trends: The bottles market is growing, with a shift towards sustainable materials [5], but antique bottles have their own niche. The value can vary based on color and historical context, as seen in [4] and [7]. For example, an amber flask from the Civil War era can be quite valuable.

Where to buy/sell: Antique shops, online auctions, and specialized bottle shows are mentioned in [7] and [4]. Authenticity verification is crucial, so provenance and expert appraisal are important.

Care and maintenance: Avoid harsh chemicals and use gentle cleaning methods. Sources [6] and [13] recommend using mild soap, avoiding dishwashers, and handling with care to preserve the markings.

I need to structure all this into sections with headers, ensuring each part flows into the next. Use specific examples like the SF & PGW mark or the Union-Clasped Hands-Eagle flask. Cite sources appropriately, like [1] for mold numbers and [7] for manufacturer trademarks. Make sure to avoid lists and keep the narrative flowing with paragraphs. Also, check that each section addresses the user's points thoroughly, using the provided search results as evidence.

# Antique Identification of Glass Bottle Markings on the Bottom: A Comprehensive Guide  

The study of markings on the bottoms of antique glass bottles offers a window into the history of glassmaking, industrial manufacturing, and consumer culture. These markings—ranging from mold numbers to manufacturer trademarks—serve as critical identifiers for dating bottles, tracing their origins, and assessing their historical and monetary value. This guide synthesizes historical context, typology, valuation factors, authentication methods, market trends, and preservation strategies to provide a holistic resource for collectors, historians, and enthusiasts.

## 1. Definition and Significance of Antique Glass Bottle Markings  

Antique glass bottle markings on the bottom are embossed or etched symbols, numbers, or letters created during the manufacturing process. These markings served practical purposes for glassmakers, such as identifying molds, tracking production batches, or denoting manufacturers. For modern researchers, they are invaluable for:  

- **Dating bottles**: Mold numbers, date codes, and manufacturing techniques correlate with specific historical periods[1][8].  
- **Identifying provenance**: Trademarks or logos link bottles to glasshouses or geographic regions[7][10].  
- **Assessing authenticity**: Features like pontil marks or mold seams distinguish hand-blown from machine-made bottles[8][10].  
- **Determining value**: Rare markings or associations with historical events elevate desirability[2][4].  

For example, a bottle marked "SF & PGW" on its base refers to the San Francisco & Pacific Glass Works, active from 1876 to 1902, immediately situating it in the post-Gold Rush era of West Coast industrialization[7].

## 2. Historical Evolution of Bottle Markings  

### Early Techniques (Pre-1850s)  
Hand-blown bottles dominated production until the mid-19th century. Bases often featured **pontil marks**—rough, circular scars from iron rods used to hold bottles during shaping. These marks, absent in machine-made bottles, are hallmarks of pre-1850 craftsmanship[8][10]. Free-blown bottles lacked mold seams, while "dip molds" (used to shape bodies before hand-finishing) left subtle vertical lines[13].  

### Industrialization (1850s–1910s)  
The advent of mold-based manufacturing introduced **mold seams** along bottle sides and bases. Early molds produced "cup-base" bottles with indented bottoms, while later innovations enabled flat bases. Marks evolved to include:  
- **Mold numbers**: Single or double digits (e.g., "12") identified individual molds in multi-cavity machines[1].  
- **Manufacturer trademarks**: Symbols like the Midland Glass Company’s stylized "M" (resembling three underlined Roman numerals "I") emerged[1][7].  

### Automation (1920s–Present)  
Fully automatic bottle machines (e.g., Owens Bottle Machine) standardized production. Bases began featuring **suction scars** (large circular marks) or **valve marks** (smaller circles), indicative of 1910–1950 manufacturing[13]. Post-1950 bottles often have stippled or knurled textures to prevent conveyor sticking[13].

## 3. Types of Bottle Base Markings  

### Mold Identification Marks  
- **Mold numbers**: Numeric codes (e.g., "76") tracked molds for quality control. Higher numbers often indicate later production[1][9].  
- **Cavity identifiers**: Letters or numbers distinguished sections in multi-part molds[10].  

### Manufacturer Marks  
- **Trademarks**: Logos like the "star" symbol of San Francisco & Pacific Glass Works (1876–1902)[10].  
- **Acid badges**: Etched marks (e.g., "Owens-Illinois") denoting glassmakers[12].  

### Date and Location Codes  
- **Date stamps**: Four-digit years (e.g., "1905") or cryptic codes (e.g., "76" for 1976)[1][7].  
- **Geographic indicators**: City names (e.g., "Pittsburgh, PA") or regional symbols[7].  

### Production Process Indicators  
- **Pontil marks**: Rough scars from hand-blowing rods (pre-1850)[8][10].  
- **Machine marks**: Valve or suction scars (post-1910)[13].

## 5. Authentication Techniques  

### Physical Inspection  
- **Mold seams**: Pre-1910 seams stop below the lip; post-1910 seams extend to the rim[3][9].  
- **Pontil marks**: Absence indicates post-1850 production[8][10].  

### Mark Analysis  
- **Embossing quality**: Crude, uneven lettering suggests pre-1900 hand-engraved molds[9].  
- **Trademark cross-referencing**: Databases like *Bottle Makers and Their Marks* (Toulouse, 1971) verify manufacturer logos[10].  

### Provenance Verification  
- **Archaeological context**: Bottles found in dated trash deposits (e.g., 1860s Youngstown, Ohio) provide temporal anchors[7].  
- **Historical records**: Patent numbers (e.g., embossed "Pat. 1887") correlate with USPTO filings[9].
