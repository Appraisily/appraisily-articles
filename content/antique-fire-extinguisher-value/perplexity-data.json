The sources note that unrestored soda-acid models are $100-$200 but often sell for half. Also, fire grenades vary from $25 to over $2,000. I need to explain how each factor influences price, using specific examples from the search results.\n\nIdentifying authenticity involves checking materials, labels, and signs of age. The sources mention looking for brass or copper construction, original labels, and wear patterns. For example, the Buffalo extinguisher from [3] has specific markings that authenticate it.\n\nMarket trends and pricing: The Kijiji listings [4] show a range from $20 to $500, depending on type and condition. Recent auctions, like the group of five selling for varying prices [5], indicate that collections can be valuable. Also, fire grenades' prices have stagnated but rare ones still fetch high amounts [2].\n\nWhere to buy/sell: Online auctions (eBay, LiveAuctioneers), antique stores, and specialized dealers. The user mentioned Sotheby's and local antique shops. The Kijiji ads [4] show various platforms used in Ontario, which can be examples.\n\nCare and maintenance: Sources [6], [7], [8] emphasize professional handling due to dangerous residues. Restoration can add value, but improper cleaning might damage them. For example, [9] details a restoration process using oil and heat, which should be done by experts.\n\nI need to ensure each section flows into the next, using headers as specified. Including citations from the provided sources is crucial. For example, when discussing soda-acid extinguishers, cite [1] and [15]. Mention fire grenade values with [2] and [16].\n\nAlso, check for any conflicting information. For instance, [1] says unrestored soda-acid models are $100-$200, but [4] has listings both higher and lower. I should note that market variability exists based on specific factors.\n\nFinally, structure the conclusion to synthesize the key points, emphasizing the importance of research and professional appraisal. Avoid lists, use paragraphs, and ensure all citations are correctly placed. Make sure the report is around 10,000 words, with each section detailed enough to meet the user's depth requirement.\n</think>\n\n# The Comprehensive Guide to Antique Fire Extinguisher Value: History, Market Dynamics, and Preservation  \n\nAntique fire extinguishers occupy a unique niche in the collectibles market, blending industrial history, functional design, and aesthetic appeal. Their value stems from factors such as historical significance, material composition, rarity, and condition. This guide explores the multifaceted world of antique fire extinguisher valuation, offering insights into their evolution, market trends, and preservation practices.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding Antique Fire Extinguisher Value  \n\nAntique fire extinguishers are valued for their role in documenting the evolution of firefighting technology and their craftsmanship. Early models, often made of copper or brass, reflect industrial design trends of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Collectors prize these artifacts not only for their historical relevance but also for their decorative potential in modern interiors[1][15].  \n\nThe importance of these items lies in their ability to bridge utilitarian function and artistic form. For example, soda-acid extinguishers from the 1920s–1960s, with their polished brass casings, are sought after for their visual appeal despite being obsolete for firefighting[1][3]. Additionally, rare variants like fire grenades or wheeled chemical carts command higher prices due to their scarcity and unique mechanisms[2][4].  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Historical Development of Fire Extinguishers  \n\nThe history of fire extinguishers dates to 1819, when Captain George William Manby invented the first portable device using potassium carbonate and compressed air[15]. Key milestones include:  \n\n- **1866**: François Carlier’s soda-acid extinguisher, which mixed tartaric acid and sodium bicarbonate to produce carbon dioxide[15].  \n- **1905**: Pyrene Manufacturing Co.’s carbon tetrachloride extinguisher, widely used for electrical fires but phased out due to toxicity[16].  \n- **1924**: Walter Kidde’s carbon dioxide (CO₂) extinguisher, which remains in use today[15].  \n\nEarly 20th-century models, such as the Buffalo Fire Appliance Corp.’s brass extinguishers, exemplify the transition from manual pumps to pressurized systems[3]. These innovations laid the groundwork for modern firefighting tools while creating a legacy of collectible artifacts.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Types and Categories of Antique Fire Extinguishers  \n\nAntique fire extinguishers are categorized by mechanism, material, and era:  \n\n### Soda-Acid Extinguishers  \nDominant in the early 20th century, these used a chemical reaction between sodium bicarbonate and sulfuric acid to expel water. Unrestored examples typically sell for $100–$200, though prices drop to $70–$150 for worn units[1][4].  \n\n### Fire Grenades  \nGlass spheres filled with carbon tetrachloride or saltwater (late 19th–early 20th century). Values range from $25 for common Red Comet models to $2,000+ for sealed French variants like L’Incustomable[2][16].  \n\n### Wheeled Chemical Carts  \nMobile units from the 1930s, such as the Flag CPK-500-WRT, are rare and command prices up to $1,600[1][4].  \n\n### Dry Powder and CO₂ Models  \nEarly dry chemical extinguishers (post-1950s) and brass CO₂ units (1920s–1940s) appeal to industrial design enthusiasts, with prices ranging from $50 to $500 depending on condition[14][18].  \n\n---\n\n## 4.
