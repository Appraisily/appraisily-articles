Okay, I need to tackle this query about antique cat cookie jar values. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's questions and see how I can address them using the provided search results.

First, the user wants to know what antique cat cookie jar value is and why it's important. From the search results, I see that brands like Shawnee Pottery and American Bisque are mentioned, and prices vary. For example, the Shawnee Puss and Boots jar is listed at $125[1], while an American Bisque jar from the 1950s is priced around $90[2]. The value seems to come from factors like rarity, brand, condition, and design. Importance might stem from their historical significance as collectibles and decorative items from mid-century America.

Next, the historical background. The American Bisque company started in the late 1930s[2], and Shawnee Pottery was active in the mid-20th century. The development includes changes in manufacturing, like American Bisque reducing sizes in the late 1930s for shipping efficiency[2]. McCoy jars are also mentioned, with tips on identifying authentic ones by their marks and glaze[10][13].

For types and variations, the search results show different designs: Puss and Boots by Shawnee[1], Fluffy the Cat by American Bisque[2], and various Japanese-made jars like Otagiri and Royal Sealy[3][12]. There's also the Lucky Cat from World Market, inspired by Japanese Maneki-neko[4]. Categories could be based on origin (American vs. Japanese), design (anthropomorphic, holiday themes), or brands.

Determining value factors: condition is crucial. Chips or cracks lower value, as seen in listings where chips reduce prices[3][12]. Rarity plays a role; airbrushed versions are rarer[2]. Brand reputation matters—McCoy and American Bisque are sought after. Provenance and markings (like "USA" or "McCoy") also affect value[10][13].

Identifying authenticity involves checking marks, glaze quality, and mold details. McCoy jars should have clear "McCoy" or "USA" marks without blurriness[10]. American Bisque jars might have wedge-shaped bottoms[15]. Reproductions might have sloppy markings or incorrect sizes[13].

Market trends: Prices range from $20 for common jars to over $400 for rare ones[3][12]. eBay and Etsy are mentioned as marketplaces[12]. Recent sales show vintage McCoy jars can go up to $4000[13], but that's more for rare models. The Lucky Cat jar at World Market is $24.99[4], indicating modern reproductions are cheaper.

Where to buy/sell: Online platforms like eBay, Ruby Lane[1], Etsy, and specialty stores like Urban Americana[5]. Auctions, both online and physical, are venues[7][12]. Tips on evaluating sellers and avoiding fakes would be useful here.

Care and maintenance: Avoid submerging in water, especially if damaged[11][14]. Use mild cleaners, avoid abrasive tools. For cold-painted jars, gentle cleaning with cotton swabs[11]. Proper storage to prevent chips and cracks is important.

I need to structure all this into sections with examples and citations. Make sure each part flows, uses the right headers, and cites sources properly. Also, check that all eight aspects are covered comprehensively, using the search results for specific data points and examples. Avoid lists, keep it narrative, and ensure each paragraph connects logically.

# The Comprehensive Guide to Antique Cat Cookie Jar Value  

Antique cat cookie jars represent a unique intersection of functional kitchenware, mid-century design, and collectible art. Their value stems from historical significance, craftsmanship, and cultural nostalgia, with prices ranging from $20 for common examples to over $4,000 for rare models[1][2][13]. This guide explores their origins, valuation factors, market dynamics, and preservation practices, providing collectors and researchers with actionable insights.

## 1. Understanding Antique Cat Cookie Jar Value  

Antique cat cookie jars are ceramic or pottery containers produced primarily between the 1930s and 1980s, designed to store cookies while serving as decorative kitchen accents. Their value lies in three key areas:  

- **Cultural Significance**: As artifacts of mid-century Americana, they reflect design trends and domestic lifestyles of the era. For example, Shawnee Pottery’s 1950s "Puss and Boots" jar ($125)[1] embodies whimsical post-war aesthetics.  
- **Rarity**: Limited production runs, such as American Bisque’s airbrushed "Fluffy the Cat" (1958), command $150–$200 due to fewer surviving examples[2][15].  
- **Craftsmanship**: Hand-painted details and glaze quality elevate value. A 1970s Otagiri Japanese jar with intricate floral motifs sells for $42.50[3], while mass-produced modern equivalents retail under $30[4].  

Collectors prize these jars as tangible connections to manufacturing history, with institutions like the McCoy Pottery Collectors’ Society documenting their evolution[10].

## 2. Historical Development  

### Early Origins (1930s–1950s)  
The American cookie jar industry emerged in the 1930s, influenced by English biscuit jars. American Bisque pioneered figural designs, introducing animal-themed jars like their 1938 "Kitten on Beehive"[15]. Post-WWII demand spurred innovation:  
- **Shawnee Pottery** (1940s–1950s): Known for bold glazes, their 10" "Puss and Boots" model[1] became a staple in suburban kitchens.  
- **McCoy Pottery**: Their 1950s "Cat on Coal Bucket" jar combined functionality with folk art, now valued at $100–$300[7].  

### Japanese Influence (1960s–1980s)  
Japanese manufacturers like Otagiri and Lefton entered the market with anthropomorphic designs. The 1960s "Lipper Mann Dancing Cats" jar ($65.99)[3] typifies this era’s kitsch appeal. By the 1980s, declining quality led to factory closures, cementing earlier pieces as collectibles[15].

### Glaze and Mold Quality  
Authentic pieces exhibit smooth, semi-gloss finishes. Reproductions often have cloudy glazes or blurred mold lines (e.g., fake "Brush McCoy" jars)[13].  

### Weight and Dimensions  
Genuine McCoy jars weigh 2–3 lbs due to thick ceramic. Lightweight copies (1–1.5 lbs) suggest modern materials[10].
