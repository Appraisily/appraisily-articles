  "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user with their research on antique dolls' value. Let me start by understanding the query. They want a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects. The search results provided have a lot of information, so I need to go through each one and extract relevant data.\n\nFirst, defining antique dolls' value and its importance. From the sources, I see that value is determined by factors like age, condition, maker, rarity, and provenance. Importance comes from historical significance and investment potential. Sources [4], [9], and [15] mention these points. \n\nNext, historical background. The Wikipedia entry [2] talks about bisque dolls from the 19th century, French and German manufacturers like Jumeau and Bru. Source [6] discusses the shift from antique to modern collectibles. I should note the transition from adult fashion dolls to childlike ones in the late 19th century.\n\nTypes and categories: The search results mention bisque, porcelain, composition dolls. Source [3] lists adult fashion, baby, and character dolls. Parian dolls are also mentioned there. Examples from [1] include specific dolls like the 1900 French Emile Jumeau Bebe Doll.\n\nFactors determining value: Condition, age, maker, materials, provenance, rarity. Sources [4], [9], [14], and [15] all touch on these. For example, [4] says condition and age are key, while [15] emphasizes maker reputation.\n\nIdentifying authentic dolls: Look for maker's marks, materials, construction details. Source [3] mentions checking marks, and [13] advises checking for original parts and condition. The YouTube transcript [5] shows an appraisal example.\n\nMarket trends: Source [6] mentions that antique dolls hold value better than mass-produced ones. Recent auction prices from [1] and [5] give current examples, like the $12,000-$14,000 appraisal for a Bru doll.\n\nBuying/selling venues: Auction houses like Frasher's [7], online platforms like eBay, specialized dealers like GiGi's [11]. \n\nCare and preservation: Climate control, avoiding sunlight, proper handling. Source [8] has detailed tips on storage and cleaning. \n\nI need to structure all this into sections with headers, using specific examples and citing sources. Make sure each section addresses the user's points, using the most relevant sources. For instance, in the historical section, cite [2] and [6]. In factors, use [4], [9], [14], [15]. Examples from [1] and [5] will illustrate points. \n\nCheck that each citation is correctly numbered and only the most relevant sources are cited per point. Avoid listing too many citations in one sentence. Also, ensure the answer is comprehensive but not redundant, covering all eight aspects the user requested. Use tables where comparisons are needed, like in types of dolls. Make sure the flow is logical and each section builds on the previous one. Finally, wrap up with a summary that ties everything together.\n</think>\n\nAntique dolls hold significant historical, artistic, and financial value, with rare examples selling for over $100,000 at auction[1][5][15].
