Okay, I need to answer this query about the value of old cash registers. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to make sure I cover everything they asked for. 

First, understanding what old cash registers' value means. From the search results, it seems their value comes from historical significance, craftsmanship, and collectibility. The National Cash Register Company (NCR) models are especially prized. I should mention how factors like age, condition, and rarity contribute to their value. Sources like [1], [9], and [11] talk about prices and why they're valuable.

Next, the historical background. The user wants the development over time. James Ritty invented the first cash register in 1879, which is covered in [9]. Then NCR took over, leading to brass models in the early 1900s. The shift from mechanical to electronic registers in the mid-20th century is mentioned in [3] and [9]. Including the evolution of design and materials here would make sense.

For types and variations, the search results mention mechanical vs. electronic, materials like brass and wood, and brands like NCR, Hallwood, etc. [3] and [9] have good info on different types. Also, there's a mention of point-of-sale systems in [3], so I should categorize them accordingly.

Determining factors of value: Condition is key, as [4], [8], and [11] note. Working condition increases value. Rarity and age, like pre-1915 models with intricate designs from [4] and [9]. Brand reputation, especially NCR, is important from [1], [9], [11]. Provenance and historical use add value, as seen in [12] where a register's history increased its appraisal.

Identifying authentic ones: Look for serial numbers, manufacturer marks (NCR logos in [4], [5], [9]). Construction details like brass vs. reproductions, which [5] discusses with repro parts having off-center holes. Original parts and mechanisms, like the bell and crank from [4] and [9].

Market trends and pricing: Current prices range from $250 to over $10,000, with NCR models at the higher end [1], [11]. The market is niche but active, with online platforms like 1stDibs [1], [3] and auctions. The U.S. market size in [6] shows a decrease, but collectibles might be a different segment.

Where to buy/sell: Online marketplaces (1stDibs, Etsy), auctions (like the PBS example in [12]), antique dealers, and specialized collectors like [7] and [8]. Restoration services like HBAC Group [8] and American Plating Company [10] are also points to mention.

Care and maintenance: Regular cleaning, avoiding harsh chemicals [8], [10]. Professional restoration for mechanisms and finishes [8], [10]. Proper display conditions to prevent damage [8], [9].

I need to structure each section with headers, use examples like specific models and prices from the sources, and cite appropriately. Make sure to cover all eight points without missing any. Also, check that each citation is correctly referenced and that the answer flows logically from historical context to current market advice.

Old cash registers hold significant value as historical artifacts, collectible items, and functional antiques. Their worth stems from craftsmanship, historical context, and market demand among collectors. Below is a comprehensive analysis structured around your requested topics:

---

## 1. Understanding the Value of Old Cash Registers  
Antique cash registers are valued for their **historical significance**, **mechanical complexity**, and **aesthetic appeal**. Early models from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly those made by the **National Cash Register Company (NCR)**, are highly sought after. Their importance lies in:  
- **Technological innovation**: They revolutionized retail accountability.  
- **Artistic design**: Brass models often feature intricate scrollwork, floral motifs, and gold plating [9][13].  
- **Rarity**: Pre-1915 models with ornate designs or unique provenance command premium prices [4][11].  

---

## 2. Historical Background  
- **1879**: James Ritty invented the first mechanical cash register to prevent employee theft in his Ohio saloon [9].  
- **1884**: John H. Patterson acquired Ritty’s patent, founding NCR and standardizing production. Early NCR models featured brass construction and hand-cranked mechanisms [2][9].  
- **Early 1900s**: Shift toward electric registers began, though mechanical models remained popular until the 1960s [3][13].  
- **Modern era**: Transition to digital POS systems rendered mechanical registers obsolete, fueling their collectibility [3][6].

## 3. Types and Variations  
### Key Categories:  
| **Type**               | **Features**                                                                 | **Examples**                     |

| **Wooden Case**         | Oak or walnut cabinets, pre-1900                                            | Sun Manufacturing Co. models [7] |  
| **Electric**            | Mid-20th-century models with basic automation                               | NCR Class 5 (1950s) [3]          |  
| **Store-Specific**      | Customized with merchant logos or oversized drawers for large banknotes [2] | General Store registers [9]      |

## 4. Factors Determining Value  
- **Condition**: Fully functional registers with original parts fetch 20–50% more. Non-working models may drop to $250–$1,000 [1][4].  
- **Age and Rarity**: Pre-1915 brass NCR models (e.g., Model 33) average $3,000–$6,000 [11][12].  
- **Aesthetics**: Gold-plated or engraved designs increase value. A 1900s NCR brass register sold for $8,880 on 1stDibs [1].  
- **Provenance**: Registers tied to historic businesses or figures gain premiums. A PBS-appraised NCR model with documented history reached $6,000 [12].  

---

## 5. Authenticity Identification  
- **Serial Numbers**: Located beneath the drawer; NCR models have unique identifiers traceable to production years [4][9].  
- **Construction**: Authentic brass registers weigh 50–100 lbs and show milling marks on feet (reproductions lack these) [5][9].  
- **Mechanisms**: Original models include a bell, hand crank, and adder wheels. Reproductions often omit functional parts [4][8].  
- **Brand Marks**: Look for “National Cash Register Co.” stamps or retailer plaques [9][12].  

---

## 6. Market Trends and Pricing  
- **Current Prices**: Range from $250 (damaged electric models) to $26,000+ (rare brass NCR units) [11][13].  
- **Demand**: NCR brass registers dominate 70% of collector interest, while “off-brand” models appeal to niche buyers [11].  
- **Market Shift**: U.S. cash register market contracted by 16.8% in 2024 ($1.1B), but antique sales remain robust through online platforms [6][13].  

---

## 7. Acquisition and Sales Channels  
- **Online Marketplaces**: 1stDibs lists NCR models at $2,730–$8,880 [1][3]. Etsy and eBay feature mid-range options ($1,000–$5,000) [13].  
- **Auctions**: Specialized antique auctions (e.g., Sotheby’s, local estate sales) often yield high-value pieces [12].  
- **Restoration Experts**: HBAC Group and American Plating Company restore and resell registers [8][10].  

---

## 8. Preservation and Care  
- **Cleaning**: Use mild soap and soft cloths. Avoid abrasive chemicals to prevent brass tarnishing [8][10].  
- **Mechanical Maintenance**: Lubricate gears annually; consult specialists for repairs to avoid devaluation [8].  
- **Storage**: Keep in climate-controlled environments to prevent wood warping or metal corrosion [9][13].  
- **Restoration Costs**: Full refurbishment (polishing, re-nickeling, woodwork) averages $2,000–$5,000 but can double resale value [8][10].  

---

### Summary  
Old cash registers blend historical innovation with artistic craftsmanship, making them prized collectibles. Values hinge on age, brand, and condition, with NCR brass models leading the market. Collectors should prioritize authentication and professional restoration to maximize investment potential.
