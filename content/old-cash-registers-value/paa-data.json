How much are old cash registers worth?**\n\n**Answer:**  The value of an old cash register is incredibly variable and depends on several key factors.  There's no single price.  A common, mass-produced model from the mid-20th century might only fetch $50-$200, while a rare, early-20th-century model from a prestigious manufacturer like National Cash Register (NCR) or Burroughs in excellent, working condition could be worth thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars.  Several crucial elements determine value:\n\n* **Manufacturer and Model:**  NCR, Burroughs, and early automatic machines are generally more valuable. Specific models within those brands also have varying degrees of desirability among collectors.\n* **Condition:**  A fully functional, meticulously restored register in its original paint and with all its original parts will command a much higher price than a damaged, incomplete, or non-working one.\n* **Rarity:**  The fewer examples of a particular model exist, the higher its value.  Limited edition or special-order registers are highly sought after.\n* **Historical Significance:** Registers used in famous businesses or associated with historical events can significantly increase their worth.\n* **Completeness:**  The presence of all original accessories (keys, trays, manuals) significantly increases value.\n\n\n**2. How can I identify the maker and model of my old cash register?**\n\n**Answer:**  Identifying your cash register's maker and model is crucial for determining its value.  Look for markings on the machine itself.  These are usually found on a metal plate or tag, often on the front, back, or underside of the register.  The maker's name (e.g., NCR, Burroughs, Victor) will be prominently displayed.  The model number, often a combination of letters and numbers, is equally important for identification.  High-resolution photos of all visible markings are essential.  Online resources like eBay completed listings, antique cash register forums, and specialized collector websites can help you cross-reference your findings.  If you're unsure, consider contacting an antique appraiser or a specialist in cash register restoration for professional identification.\n\n\n**3. Where can I find information about the history of my old cash register?**\n\n**Answer:**  Researching the history of your cash register can enhance its value and provide a fascinating glimpse into the past. Start by identifying the maker and model (see question 2). Once you have this information, online searches can uncover a wealth of historical data.  Manufacturer websites (if still active) may offer archives or historical information.  Museums dedicated to business history or technology often have collections of cash registers and related documentation.  Books and articles on the history of cash registers and the companies that produced them are also valuable resources.  Online forums dedicated to antique cash register collecting are excellent places to connect with experienced collectors who can share their knowledge and point you to relevant resources.\n\n\n**4. What are the common problems with old cash registers?**\n\n**Answer:**  Old cash registers, due to their age and mechanical nature, are prone to several issues.  These include:\n\n1. **Mechanical malfunctions:**  Worn gears, springs, and other internal components can lead to malfunctioning mechanisms.\n2. **Key sticking or breakage:** Frequent use can wear down keys, causing them to stick or break.\n3. **Paint deterioration:**  Age and exposure can lead to chipping, fading, or rusting of the paint.\n4. **Missing parts:**  Over time, components might go missing, diminishing the register's value and functionality.\n5. **Electrical issues (for electric models):**  Wiring, motors, and other electrical components can fail.\n\nAddressing these issues often requires specialized knowledge and tools, potentially making restoration expensive.\n\n\n**5. Where can I buy or sell an old cash register?**\n\n**Answer:**  Several avenues exist for buying and selling old cash registers.  Online auction sites like eBay are popular platforms, offering a broad reach but requiring careful scrutiny of listings.  Specialized antique and collectible marketplaces, either online or physical, often feature cash registers.  Antique shops and auction houses specializing in business memorabilia can be good sources.  Joining online forums and communities dedicated to cash register collecting can connect you with buyers and sellers, often providing opportunities to find rare or unique machines.  When selling, be sure to accurately describe the condition and provide high-quality photographs.\n\n\n**6.  How do I get my old cash register appraised?**\n\n**Answer:** Getting your old cash register appraised is crucial for accurate valuation, especially if you intend to sell or insure it.  Several options exist:\n\n* **Antique appraisers:** General antique appraisers may have some knowledge of cash registers, but specialized knowledge is preferable.\n* **Cash register collectors/restorers:**  Individuals with extensive experience in this field can provide a more accurate assessment.\n* **Auction houses:**  Auction houses specializing in antiques or collectibles can provide appraisals, often in conjunction with consignment sales.\n\nEnsure the appraiser has experience with antique cash registers and provides a written appraisal detailing the assessment methodology and supporting rationale.\n\n\n**7. What should I look for when buying an old cash register?**\n\n**Answer:** Buying an old cash register requires careful consideration.  Prioritize the following:\n\n1. **Condition:**  Thoroughly inspect the register for damage, wear, and missing parts.  Photographs often don't reveal the full extent of condition issues.\n2. **Functionality:**  If possible, test the register's mechanical functions to ensure it operates correctly.\n3. **Authenticity:**  Verify the manufacturer and model to avoid counterfeits or misrepresented items.\n4. **Documentation:**  Original manuals, keys, and any accompanying documentation significantly enhance value.\n5. **Price:**  Research comparable models to ensure you're paying a fair price.  Don't hesitate to negotiate.  Consider restoration costs if the register needs work.\n",
