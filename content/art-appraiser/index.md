Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive query about art appraisers. Let me start by breaking down each of the eight points the user wants covered. 

First, understanding what an art appraiser is and their importance. From the search results, I see that art appraisers evaluate art's value, considering factors like authenticity, provenance, and market trends. Their role is crucial for insurance, sales, and legal purposes. Sources [1], [2], and [6] mention their duties and certifications.

Next, the historical background. The PDF from source [10] talks about the emergence of art dealers in the 18th and 19th centuries, linking it to political upheavals in Europe. This probably ties into the development of appraisers as the art market grew. I should connect historical events like the French Revolution and the rise of auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's.

For different types of art appraisals, source [4] lists seven methods, but the user might need a concise list. The Comparative Method and Expert Opinion Approach are key. Also, source [5] mentions factors influencing value, which could be integrated here.

Determining value factors: Artist reputation, provenance, condition, and market trends are highlighted in sources [5] and [15]. Condition is especially stressed in [9] and [15], where conservators' reports impact appraisals.

Identifying authentic appraisers involves checking certifications from bodies like AAA or ISA, as per [6]. Also, looking for USPAP compliance from [1] and [6] is important.

Current market trends: Source [7] discusses AI and blockchain in 2025, which are tech trends affecting appraisals. Online services and remote assessments are mentioned here. Also, the growth of the art market from [6] implies higher demand for appraisers.

Where to buy/sell: Auction houses, galleries, and online platforms like the one in [8]. Also, working with certified appraisers from [6] and [8] is key.

Care and maintenance: Sources [13], [14], and [15] emphasize proper handling, environment control, and professional conservation. Logging maintenance and using platforms like Artwork Archive from [13] can help preserve value.

I need to structure each section with headers, cite sources properly, and ensure all eight points are covered comprehensively. Make sure to use specific examples, like blockchain in tech trends, and case studies where possible, maybe from the sources provided. Avoid redundancy and keep each section focused. Also, check that all citations are correctly numbered based on the provided search results.
