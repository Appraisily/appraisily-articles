What factors determine the value of an old military button?**\n\n**Answer:** The value of an old military button is multifaceted, influenced by several key factors. Rarity is paramount; buttons from short-lived units, experimental designs, or specific manufacturers are highly sought after. Material composition plays a role â€“ buttons made of gold, silver, or scarce alloys command higher prices than those crafted from brass or base metals. Condition is crucial; buttons with minimal wear, intact shanks, and clear markings fetch more.\n\n*   **Unit Affiliation:** Buttons from prestigious or historically significant units (e.g., Civil War cavalry, Revolutionary War regiments) tend to be more valuable.\n*   **Maker Marks:** The presence of a maker's mark from a well-known or documented button manufacturer (e.g., Scovill, Waterbury) adds to the desirability and value. Research these makers to establish age and context.\n*   **Design Complexity:** Intricate designs, raised details, and unusual motifs increase the button's aesthetic appeal and potentially its value.\n*   **Size:** Larger buttons generally command higher prices than smaller ones, all other factors being equal.\n*   **Provenance:** If the button's history and ownership can be traced (e.g., documentation linking it to a specific soldier or event), its value significantly increases. Always research the button's background and context.\n\n**2. How can I identify an authentic old military button?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying an authentic old military button requires careful examination and research. Begin by scrutinizing the button's construction and material. Authentic buttons usually exhibit a higher level of craftsmanship than reproductions. Look for signs of age, such as patina, slight imperfections, and wear consistent with the button's purported age.\n\n*   **Compare to Known Examples:** Use online resources like military button databases (e.g., Military Buttons of the World) or books (e.g., Albert's Record of American Uniform and Historical Buttons) to compare your button to authenticated examples.\n*   **Check for Maker Marks:** Examine the back of the button for maker's marks. Research these marks to verify their authenticity and the period they were used.\n*   **Test the Material (Non-Destructively):** A simple magnet test can help determine if the button is made of ferrous metal (iron or steel), which can provide clues about its age and origin.\n*   **Examine the Shank:** The shank (the loop on the back used for attachment) should be securely attached and consistent with the button's overall age and construction.\n*   **Consult with Experts:** If you're unsure, consult with a knowledgeable button collector, antique dealer, or military historian. They can provide valuable insights and help you determine the button's authenticity. Avoid aggressive cleaning as it can damage the button and reduce its value.\n\n**3. What are some common fakes or reproductions of old military buttons? How can I spot them?**\n\n**Answer:** The market for old military buttons is unfortunately plagued by fakes and reproductions. Recognizing these imitations is crucial to avoid costly mistakes. Many reproductions are made of inferior materials, such as cheap plastic or poorly cast metal.\n\n*   **Look for \"Made in China\" or other modern markings:** These are obvious red flags.\n*   **Examine the details:** Reproductions often lack the crisp details and fine craftsmanship of original buttons. The details may appear blurry or poorly defined.\n*   **Check the shank attachment:** The shanks of reproductions are often weakly attached or made of a different metal than the button itself.\n*   **Compare the patina:** Reproductions may have a fake or artificial patina that looks unnatural. Original buttons develop a genuine patina over time due to oxidation and exposure to the elements.\n*   **Be wary of buttons offered in large quantities:** Authentic, rare buttons are seldom available in bulk. If a seller is offering multiple examples of a rare button, it's likely a reproduction.\n*   **Consider the Price:** If a button is priced significantly lower than similar examples, it's a strong indication that it's a fake. Research the market value of comparable buttons before making a purchase.\n\n**4. Where can I find old military buttons?**\n\n**Answer:** Finding old military buttons can be an exciting treasure hunt! Several avenues are available to collectors and enthusiasts:\n\n*   **Online Auction Sites (eBay, etc.):** These platforms offer a vast selection of buttons from various eras and countries. However, exercise caution and carefully examine the photos and descriptions before bidding.\n*   **Antique Stores and Flea Markets:** These venues can be a great source of hidden gems. Take your time to browse and ask questions.\n*   **Estate Sales:** Estate sales often yield unexpected finds, including old military buttons.\n*   **Metal Detecting:** With proper permission and research, metal detecting in areas with historical military activity can uncover lost buttons. Remember to follow all local laws and regulations.\n*   **Military Shows and Collectibles Fairs:** These events bring together dealers and collectors, providing an opportunity to view and purchase a wide range of military items, including buttons.\n*   **Online Forums and Communities:** Joining online forums dedicated to button collecting can connect you with other enthusiasts who may be willing to sell or trade buttons.\n*   **Directly from Collectors:** Sometimes, connecting with other collectors through clubs or online communities can lead to private sales and opportunities to acquire rare buttons.\n\n**5. How should I clean and care for my old military buttons?**\n\n**Answer:** Cleaning and caring for old military buttons requires a gentle approach to preserve their value and integrity. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the button's surface and patina.\n\n*   **Start with a Soft Brush:** Gently brush away loose dirt and debris with a soft-bristled brush.\n*   **Mild Soap and Water:** If necessary, wash the button with lukewarm water and a mild soap (e.g., dish soap). Use a soft cloth or cotton swab to gently clean the surface.\n*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the button thoroughly with clean water to remove any soap residue.\n*   **Dry Carefully:** Pat the button dry with a soft cloth. Avoid using a hairdryer or other heat source, as this can damage the button.\n*   **Storage:** Store your buttons in a dry, acid-free environment to prevent corrosion and deterioration. Individual button holders or display cases are ideal for protecting your collection. Consider using silica gel packets to absorb moisture.\n*   **Avoid Polishing:** Polishing can remove the patina and reduce the button's value. If you're unsure about cleaning a particular button, consult with a professional conservator.\n\n**6. What resources are available for researching old military buttons?**\n\n**Answer:** Researching old military buttons can be a fascinating journey into history. Several valuable resources can aid your exploration:\n\n*   **Albert's Record of American Uniform and Historical Buttons:** A comprehensive reference book considered the \"bible\" for American button collectors.\n*   **Tice's Uniform Buttons:** Another valuable resource for identifying and dating American military buttons.\n*   **Military Buttons of the World (Online Database):** A searchable online database with images and information on military buttons from around the globe.\n*   **The National Button Society:** A membership organization dedicated to the study and appreciation of buttons.

What is the value of a Civil War military button?**\n\n**Answer:** The value of a Civil War military button varies significantly based on several factors, including rarity, condition, and unit affiliation. Common Union infantry buttons in good condition might fetch $10-$30. However, rarer examples, such as those from specific regiments, officers' buttons, or those made of precious metals, can be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars.\n\n*   **Confederate Buttons:** Confederate buttons are generally more valuable than Union buttons due to their relative scarcity. A Confederate staff officer's button in excellent condition could command several thousand dollars.\n*   **Button Type:** General service buttons are the most common, while buttons from specific artillery, cavalry, or infantry units are often more desirable.\n*   **Condition:** Buttons with minimal wear, clear markings, and intact shanks will always command higher prices. Damage, such as cracks, chips, or corrosion, will significantly reduce the value.\n*   **Maker's Marks:** The presence of a rare or desirable maker's mark can increase the button's value. Research the maker to determine their significance.\n*   **Provenance:** Documented provenance (e.g., proof that the button belonged to a specific soldier) can dramatically increase the button's value. Always research the button's history and context. Before selling, consider getting the button professionally appraised to determine its fair market value.\n",
