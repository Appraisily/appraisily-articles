First, I need to understand each part of the query and map it to the provided search results. \n\nStarting with the first point: What is his art value and why is it important? From the search results, Chris DeRubeis is known for his Abstract Sensualism, working with metal, chemicals, and unique techniques. His art's value likely comes from the innovation, materials, and the emotional impact. The importance would be his contribution to contemporary art, redefining mediums. Sources [1], [3], [6], [7] mention his techniques and recognition, which I can cite here.\n\nNext, historical background. The search results detail his early life, education, and career milestones. Born in 1978, started with airbrushing, attended art schools, developed his style while working on motorcycles, and his 2005 award. Sources [1], [2], [5], [7] have this info. Need to structure this into a timeline.\n\nTypes or categories of his art. The search results mention he works on metal panels, uses different metals like aluminum, silver, gold. Also, his pieces vary in size, some are multi-panel installations. Sources [4], [7], [9] list specific works and materials. Maybe categorize by medium, size, or themes like cosmic or elemental.\n\nFactors determining value. Rarity since each piece is unique (source [7]), materials used, size, provenance, awards (2005 MUSE Award), and market demand. Also, his collaborations, like with David Smith, and gallery exhibitions. Sources [6], [7], [9] discuss these aspects.\n\nIdentifying authentic pieces. Since each is unique, authentication might involve provenance, certificates, gallery verification. His techniques leave distinct textures and effects. Sources [7], [12] mention his methods and protective coatings, which could help in verification.\n\nMarket trends and pricing. Auction results from sources [6], [9], [10] show prices ranging from $1,700 to $8,900. Larger pieces and unique installations command higher prices. The market seems active with demand from collectors.\n\nWhere to buy/sell. Galleries like Park West, Art Brokerage, Lion & Unicorn. Auctions on Invaluable, MutualArt. His own gallery in Key West (source [13]). Mention these platforms and the importance of reputable dealers.\n\nCare and maintenance. Source [12] has specific tips: use microfiber cloths, diluted spray detailer, avoid metal polish. Proper hanging techniques due to weight. Highlight these points to preserve the metal and coatings.\n\nNeed to ensure each section is backed by the sources, cite appropriately, and structure with headers. Avoid redundancy, keep it concise but thorough. Check if all eight points are covered. Also, include examples like specific artworks and their prices from the search results to illustrate points. Make sure the flow is logical, moving from definition to history, types, factors, authentication, market, buying/selling, and care. Use subheadings where necessary, but keep the main sections as per the query. Double-check citations to match the correct sources. Finally, maintain an expert tone without personal opinions, sticking to the facts from the provided materials.\n</think>\n\nChris DeRubeis has emerged as a groundbreaking figure in contemporary art through his **Abstract Sensualism®** style, creating dynamic metal-based works that command significant attention in the art market.
