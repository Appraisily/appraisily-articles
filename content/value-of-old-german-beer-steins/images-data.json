    "prompt": "Photorealistic image capturing an antique appraisal scene, landscape format (16:9). A richly detailed, ornate antique German beer stein (Mettlach style, stoneware with intricate pewter lid) sits prominently on the left side of a heavy, dark wood antique desk. On the right, the focused hands of an elderly appraiser wearing tweed hold a vintage magnifying glass over the stein's base, examining the maker's mark. Scattered nearby are appraisal tools: a small brass ruler, an open reference book with illustrations, and a notepad. Soft, directional window light illuminates the scene from the left, highlighting textures. The background shows a blurred study with bookshelves. Professional, academic aesthetic, shallow depth of field focusing on the stein and hands. --ar 16:9 --style raw",

Three different antique German beer steins (one tall stoneware, one shorter porcelain, one glass with pewter lid) rest on a worn, heavy wooden table in the foreground. One stein is slightly angled, showing its interior. Faint light from an unseen window catches the condensation on one stein. The background features dark wood paneling, rough ceiling beams, and a hint of a stone hearth, creating historical context.
