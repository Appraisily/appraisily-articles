For instance, a rare cleek from the early 1900s or an original spoon in good condition can be worth a significant sum. Brand Reputation also plays a big role.\nSep 6, 2024",

      "snippet": "Irons clubs with smooth faces (no lines, dots, or other patterns) went out of style before 1910. These are older and generally more valuable. Old wooden clubs with long, narrow heads are good. Clubs marked “patent” attract collectors, because they are rarer than non-patent clubs.",
