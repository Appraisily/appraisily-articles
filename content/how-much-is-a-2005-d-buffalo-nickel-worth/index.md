Okay, let's tackle this query about the 2005 D Buffalo Nickel. The user wants a comprehensive article covering several aspects, so I need to make sure each section is well-researched and detailed. First, I'll start by understanding what exactly the 2005 D Buffalo Nickel is. From the search results, it's part of the Westward Journey series, commemorating the Lewis and Clark expedition. The Denver mint produced a large number, but certain errors like the Speared Bison can make some coins valuable. 

Next, the historical background. The original Buffalo Nickel was from 1913-1938, and the 2005 version is a commemorative issue. The design by Jamie Franki is important here. I should mention the mintage numbers from the sources: Denver minted around 487 million, which is a lot, so most are common. But the San Francisco proofs are rarer. 

For types and variations, the main categories are the regular strike, proof coins, and error coins. The Speared Bison error is a key variation, with values ranging up to thousands. Other errors like die cracks or off-center strikes also add value. The mint marks (P, D, S) are crucial, but the user specifically asked about the D mint, so focus there.

Factors affecting value include condition (graded from Poor to Mint State), presence of errors, and market demand. The sources mention that circulated coins are face value, but uncirculated can go up to $5, and errors like the Speared Bison can reach $2,650. Also, recent trends show higher grades (MS67) increasing in value, while lower grades are more stable.

Identifying authentic coins involves checking the mint mark under Jefferson's portrait, looking for errors, and assessing wear. Professional grading services like PCGS or NGC are recommended. The sources warn against cleaning coins, as that can damage them and reduce value.

Market trends from the search results indicate that high-grade error coins have fluctuated, with some peaks in auctions. The 2005 D Speared Bison in MS66 sold for $2,650 in 2021. Current prices for proofs and uncirculated coins are provided in the tables from the sources, so I should include those.

Where to buy or sell: Online marketplaces, auctions, coin dealers, and shows. The sources mention eBay for auctions and professional grading services for authentication. Preservation tips include proper storage in acid-free materials, avoiding handling, and controlling humidity. The cleaning method with Worcestershire sauce was mentioned in one source, but I should note that cleaning is generally discouraged unless done carefully.

I need to structure all this into the required sections, making sure each part flows into the next. Use specific examples like the Speared Bison error and reference the auction records. Cite the sources appropriately, using the brackets for each reference. Also, check that all user questions are addressed, like care and maintenance, which ties into storage and handling. Avoid lists, use paragraphs, and ensure each section has subsections where necessary. Make sure to mention the composition (75% copper, 25% nickel) and physical specs as part of the identification. Highlight the importance of professional grading and the risks of counterfeit coins. 

I should also compare the D and P mint marks briefly, as the user asked about D specifically, but context from other mints might be useful. Emphasize that while most D nickels are common, errors make certain specimens valuable. Current market data from the sources will help illustrate pricing trends. Finally, conclude with the potential for future appreciation, especially for high-grade or error coins, and the importance of preservation for maintaining value.

# Comprehensive Analysis of the 2005 D Buffalo Nickel: Value, Rarity, and Preservation  

The 2005 D Buffalo Nickel, part of the Westward Journey Nickel Series commemorating the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, represents a modern revival of the iconic Buffalo Nickel design first introduced in 1913.

## Historical Context and Significance of the 2005 D Buffalo Nickel  

### Origins of the Buffalo Nickel Design  
The Buffalo Nickel, originally designed by James Earle Fraser in 1913, featured a Native American profile on the obverse and an American bison on the reverse. This design symbolized the American West and remained in circulation until 1938. In 2005, the U.S. Mint reintroduced the bison motif as part of the Westward Journey Nickel Series, which celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Sculptor Jamie Franki reimagined the reverse design, positioning the bison facing right with updated inscriptions, while the obverse retained a modified portrait of Thomas Jefferson[1][2].  

### Mintage and Distribution  
The Denver Mint produced **487,680,000** 2005 D Buffalo Nickels, making it the most abundant variety in the series[1][6]. By comparison, the Philadelphia Mint struck 448,320,000 coins, and the San Francisco Mint issued 3,344,829 proof specimens[1][2]. Despite its high mintage, the Denver variant gained notoriety due to a rare die gouge error known as the "Speared Bison," which significantly elevates its value[3][11].

## Varieties and Key Features  

### Standard 2005 D Buffalo Nickel  
The standard circulation strike features:  
- **Obverse**: Thomas Jefferson’s portrait with "Liberty" in Jefferson’s handwriting.  
- **Reverse**: A bison with "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA," "E PLURIBUS UNUM," and "FIVE CENTS" inscriptions[2][6].  
- **Mint Mark**: A "D" located below Jefferson’s portrait on the obverse[1][4].  

### Notable Varieties and Errors  
#### 1. **Speared Bison Error**  
A die gouge creates a raised line resembling a spear piercing the bison’s torso. This error, unique to Denver Mint coins, ranges in value from **$160 to $2,650**, depending on grade and error prominence[3][4][11]. An MS-66 example sold for **$2,650** in a 2021 auction[3][5].  

#### 2. **Other Errors**  
- **Die Cracks**: Visible fissures in the die transfer raised lines to the coin surface.  
- **Off-Center Strikes**: Misaligned strikes exposing blank planchet areas.  
- **Double Dies**: Overlapping impressions creating blurred details[1][2][6].  

#### 3. **Satin Finish Specimens**  
A limited number of 2005 D nickels were struck with a satin finish for mint sets. These coins exhibit subdued luster and sharper details, typically valued between **$4 and $45** in grades MS-63 to MS-66[2][4].
