  "content": "**People Also Ask (how much is a 1904 penny worth)**\n\n**1. What factors determine the value of a 1904 penny?**\n\n**Answer:** The value of a 1904 Lincoln cent, often called a \"wheat penny\" even though that name technically applies to later years, hinges on several key factors. First and foremost is its *condition*. A coin in \"mint state\" (MS), meaning uncirculated and showing no signs of wear, will be significantly more valuable than a heavily worn coin. Coin grading services like PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) and NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation) assign grades from 1 (Poor) to 70 (Mint State Perfect), and these grades directly impact price.\n\nSecondly, *rarity* plays a crucial role. While millions of 1904 pennies were minted in Philadelphia (no mint mark) and San Francisco (S mint mark), the San Francisco mint coins are considerably rarer. The specific mint mark location is on the reverse, at the bottom.\n\nThirdly, *errors* can drastically increase a penny's value. Double dies, off-center strikes, and other minting anomalies are highly sought after by collectors.\n\nFinally, *market demand* and overall economic conditions influence prices. Collector interest fluctuates, and the availability of comparable coins at auction or on online marketplaces impacts perceived value. All of these aspects combine to determine the worth of a 1904 penny.\n\n**2. How can I identify a genuine 1904 penny and avoid fakes?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying a genuine 1904 Lincoln cent involves careful observation and comparison with known characteristics. Begin by verifying the *date*. The date should be clearly struck and legible. Examine the *design elements* closely. The details of Lincoln's portrait, the lettering, and the wheat ears on the reverse should be sharp and well-defined on higher-grade coins. Compare these features with images of authenticated 1904 pennies available online from reputable sources like PCGS CoinFacts or NGC Coin Explorer.\n\nCheck for the *presence or absence of a mint mark*. Philadelphia-minted coins will have no mint mark, while San Francisco-minted coins will have an \"S\" mint mark located below the wreath on the reverse.\n\nNext, consider the *weight and diameter*. A genuine 1904 penny should weigh approximately 3.11 grams and have a diameter of 19 mm. While slight variations are possible, significant discrepancies could indicate a fake.\n\nFinally, if you're unsure, consult a *reputable coin dealer or numismatist*. They have the expertise and tools to authenticate coins and can provide a professional assessment. Beware of deals that seem too good to be true, as counterfeit coins are unfortunately common.\n\n**3. What is the value of a 1904 penny with no mint mark?**\n\n**Answer:** A 1904 Lincoln cent with no mint mark was minted in Philadelphia. Since Philadelphia produced a substantial number of these coins (over 186 million), they are generally less valuable than the 1904-S penny. In circulated condition (worn but identifiable), a 1904 penny with no mint mark might be worth only a few cents to a dollar or two. However, the condition plays a vital role.\n\nA 1904 penny in extremely fine (EF) condition, showing moderate wear on the high points, could fetch a few dollars. An almost uncirculated (AU) coin with only slight traces of wear might be worth $5-$15.\n\nThe real value jump occurs with *uncirculated* (MS) coins. An MS-63 (average uncirculated) 1904 penny might be worth $20-$50. Higher grades like MS-65 or MS-67 can command significantly higher prices, potentially reaching hundreds of dollars, especially if certified by PCGS or NGC. So, while common, a well-preserved 1904 Philadelphia penny can still be a valuable find.\n\n**4. What is the value of a 1904-S penny?**\n\n**Answer:** The 1904-S Lincoln cent, minted in San Francisco, is considerably rarer and more valuable than its Philadelphia counterpart. Only 4,662,000 were produced. Even in lower circulated grades, the 1904-S penny holds significant value. A heavily worn (Good or About Good) 1904-S might still be worth $5-$15.\n\nIn Fine (F) condition, showing moderate wear but with most details visible, the value increases to around $20-$40. An Extremely Fine (EF) example could be worth $50-$100.\n\nThe real premium, however, is for *uncirculated* (MS) examples. An MS-63 1904-S penny could easily be worth $200-$500. Higher grades, such as MS-65 or MS-67, are significantly rarer and command prices in the thousands of dollars. The highest-graded examples can fetch tens of thousands at auction. The 1904-S is a key date for Lincoln cent collectors, and its scarcity ensures a strong demand. Remember to properly authenticate any 1904-S penny before assigning a value.\n\n**5. Where can I buy or sell a 1904 penny?**\n\n**Answer:** There are several avenues for buying or selling 1904 pennies, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\n*   **Coin Dealers:** Local coin shops are a good starting point. They can offer appraisals, buy coins outright, or sell coins from their inventory. Look for reputable dealers with experience in rare coins.\n*   **Online Marketplaces:** eBay and similar platforms offer a vast selection of coins, but buyer beware. Verify the seller's reputation and carefully examine photos before bidding or buying. Consider purchasing coins graded by PCGS or NGC for added assurance.\n*   **Auction Houses:** Reputable auction houses like Heritage Auctions or Stack's Bowers Galleries specialize in rare coins. They're ideal for selling high-value coins, but they typically charge seller's fees and may require a minimum consignment value.\n*   **Coin Shows:** Coin shows are gatherings of dealers and collectors. They provide an opportunity to buy, sell, trade, and learn about coins. Check for local coin show listings in your area.\n*   **Online Forums and Communities:** Numismatic forums and social media groups can be helpful for connecting with other collectors and finding potential buyers or sellers. However, exercise caution when dealing with individuals online.\n\nWhen selling, having your coin graded by PCGS or NGC can significantly increase its marketability and value.\n\n**6. What is the historical significance of the 1904 penny?**\n\n**Answer:** While the 1904 Lincoln cent itself doesn't commemorate a specific historical event, it's significant within the broader context of U.S. coinage history. The Lincoln cent, first introduced in 1909, marked a departure from previous U.S. coin designs that typically featured Liberty or Native American figures. It was the first regularly circulating U.S. coin to feature a portrait of a real person â€“ President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe 1904 penny falls within the era of the Indian Head cent, which preceded the Lincoln cent. The Indian Head design was in circulation from 1859 to 1909. Therefore, a 1904 penny signifies a moment just before a major shift in American coinage.\n\nFurthermore, the minting of the 1904-S penny in San Francisco reflects the growth and expansion of the United States westward. The San Francisco Mint played a crucial role in processing gold and silver from the California Gold Rush and subsequent mining operations. The scarcity of the 1904-S penny serves as a reminder of the historical significance of this mint. The 1904 penny is a tangible link to the early 20th century and the changing landscape of American coinage.\n\n**7. Are there any known error coins of the 1904 penny, and how much are they worth?**\n\n**Answer:** While not as widely documented as some later Lincoln cent errors, 1904 pennies can exhibit various minting errors that significantly increase their value. Common errors to look for include:\n\n*   **Double Dies:** These occur when the die used to strike the coin receives a double impression, resulting in doubled features on the coin. Look for doubling in the date, \"LIBERTY,\" or other design elements. The strength and clarity of the doubling determine the value.\n*   **Off-Center Strikes:** An off-center strike happens when the coin is not properly aligned during striking, resulting in a portion of the design being missing. The more off-center the strike (without being completely blank), the more valuable it becomes.\n*   **Planchet Errors:** These errors involve the metal blank (planchet) before it is struck. Examples include clipped planchets (where a piece of the planchet is missing) or planchets made of the wrong metal.\n*   **Repunched Mint Marks (RPM):** Though more common on later coins, RPMs can occur on 1904-S pennies. This happens when the mint mark is punched into the die more than once, resulting in a doubled or slightly offset mint mark.\n\nThe value of a 1904 penny with an error depends on the type of error, its severity, and the coin's overall condition. Even a minor error can add a premium, while a dramatic or well-documented error can command hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Identifying errors requires careful examination and comparison to known examples. Coin error guides and online resources can be helpful in identifying and valuing these anomalies. Always consult with a knowledgeable coin dealer or grader for a professional opinion.\n",
