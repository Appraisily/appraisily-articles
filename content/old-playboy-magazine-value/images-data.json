Focus on the cover of the topmost magazine, showcasing Marilyn Monroe (if permissible, otherwise use a generic 50's pin-up style cover). Soft, warm lighting highlights the texture of the aged paper and the vibrant colors of the cover art. Shallow depth of field, blurring the magazines in the background. A vintage fountain pen and a pair of reading glasses are casually placed beside the stack. --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 5",
