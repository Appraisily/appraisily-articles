Okay, let's tackle this query about Dr. Lori, the antique appraiser. The user wants a comprehensive article covering several aspects. First, I need to figure out what exactly "lori antique appraiser" refers to. From the search results, it's clear that Dr. Lori Verderame is a professional appraiser with a Ph.D., known for her TV appearances and live events. So the first section should introduce her and explain her importance in the field.

Next, the historical background. The search results mention her education, career as a museum director, and how she started appraising after an encounter with a woman who sold a valuable document for too little. That's a good anecdote to include. Also, her TV shows and columns contribute to her development as a public figure.

For types or categories, she appraises a wide range of items listed in [3], like art, furniture, jewelry, etc. I should list some of these categories and maybe mention her online vs. in-person services as variations.

Determining value factors would involve rarity, condition, provenance, and market trends. The YouTube videos [4][5][6] discuss how rarity affects value and specific examples like the Boudin painting in [12]. Authenticity checks would involve maker's marks, materials, and expert evaluation, which she provides in her reports.

Market trends: The search results don't have recent data points, but her events and TV shows indicate ongoing popularity. The case studies in [12] and [14] show items sold for high amounts, which can illustrate current trends.

Where to buy/sell: Her website offers online appraisals, and she does live events. Also, mentions of using sales records to help sell items [1]. Preservation tips are covered in [9][11], like avoiding attics, proper cleaning, and storage methods.

I need to structure each section with headers, use examples from the sources, and cite them properly. Make sure each section answers the user's specific questions, and include case studies like the $150k painting or the Tiffany bowl found in a dumpster. Also, mention her unique approach of not buying items, ensuring unbiased appraisals.
