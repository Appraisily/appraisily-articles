They want detailed information covering eight specific aspects, from historical background to current market trends and preservation tips. \n\nFirst, I'll review the provided search results to gather all necessary data. The Susan B. Anthony dollar was minted from 1979 to 1981 and again in 1999. It was the first U.S. coin to feature a real woman, which is historically significant. The coin's value varies based on factors like mint marks, condition, and errors. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's information about the coin's introduction, design, public reception, and the different varieties like the 1979-P Wide Rim and Narrow Rim. The 1979-S proof coins have Type 1 and Type 2 variations, which affect their value. Also, errors such as off-center strikes can significantly increase a coin's worth.\n\nI need to structure the report into sections as per the user's request. Starting with an introduction that summarizes the key points. Then, historical background covering why the coin was created, its design process, and initial public reception. Next, the different types and variations, including mint marks and errors. \n\nFactors determining value would include condition (grading), mint marks, rarity of variations, and errors. Identifying authentic coins would involve checking mint marks, rim types, and signs of wear. Market trends from the sources indicate that while most coins are worth face value, certain uncirculated or error coins can fetch hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\nFor buying and selling, reputable dealers, auctions, and online platforms are mentioned. Preservation tips include proper storage and handling to avoid damage. \n\nI need to ensure each section is detailed with examples and data from the sources. For instance, in the historical section, mention the legislation and Frank Gasparro's role. In valuation, use the price tables provided. Also, cite sources appropriately using brackets. \n\nI should avoid lists and use paragraphs, ensuring a natural flow. Check that all eight aspects are covered thoroughly, and each section has subsections if needed. Make sure to highlight key points like the 1979-P Wide Rim being more valuable and the significance of proof coins. \n\nFinally, conclude by synthesizing the information and emphasizing the coin's numismatic and historical importance. Ensure citations are correctly placed after relevant sentences, using the provided search result indices. Keep the tone academic but accessible, avoiding jargon where possible.\n</think>\n\n# Comprehensive Analysis of the 1979 Susan B. Anthony Dollar Coin Value  \n\nThe 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar coin represents a pivotal moment in U.S. numismatic history, marking the first circulation coin to feature a real woman. While most examples are worth face value, specific mint marks, varieties, and errors can elevate their value to over $10,000. This report synthesizes historical context, design nuances, valuation factors, and market dynamics to provide a definitive guide for collectors and researchers.  \n\n---\n\n## Historical Background and Development  \n\n### Origins of the Susan B. Anthony Dollar  \nThe Susan B. Anthony dollar was introduced in 1979 as a cost-saving measure to replace the bulky Eisenhower dollar. The U.S. Mint aimed to reduce reliance on $1 bills, projecting annual savings of $19 million[3][12]. Legislation spearheaded by Senator William Proxmire mandated the coin’s design to honor Susan B. Anthony, a leader in the women’s suffrage movement[3][13]. Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro faced challenges in balancing historical accuracy with public appeal, ultimately settling on a portrait of Anthony at age 50 after consulting her great-niece[3][11].  \n\n### Design and Public Reception  \nThe coin’s 26.5 mm diameter and copper-nickel composition mirrored the quarter, leading to widespread confusion[2][13]. Vending machine compatibility issues and public resistance doomed its circulation prospects, with only 757 million struck in 1979[2][9]. By 1981, production halted due to stagnant demand, leaving 520 million coins in government storage[2][9]. Despite its commercial failure, the Anthony dollar influenced Canada’s 1987 Loonie design to ensure cross-border vending machine compatibility[2].  \n\n---\n\n## Types and Variations  \n\n### Mint Marks and Production Facilities  \n- **1979-P (Philadelphia)**: 360.2 million struck, including the scarce Wide Rim variety[5][10].  \n- **1979-D (Denver)**: 288 million minted, common in circulated grades[3][4].  \n- **1979-S (San Francisco)**: Proof coins only, with Type 1 (filled “S”) and Type 2 (clear “S”) varieties[6][7].  \n\n### Key Varieties  \n1. **1979-P Wide Rim (Near Date)**: Characterized by a thicker rim and closer date proximity to the edge. Only 20,000 survive, with MS67+ examples valued at $6,500[10][7].  \n2. **1979-S Type 2 Proof**: Features a sharply defined “S” mintmark. PR70 specimens fetch $60, doubling the Type 1’s value[6][7].  \n3. **Off-Center Strikes**: Errors like the 75% off-center 1979-S dollar sold for $1,000[3][12].  \n\n---\n\n## Factors Determining Value  \n\n### Condition and Grading  \n- **Circulated (XF45)**: $1.05–$1.35[8].  \n- **Uncirculated (MS65)**: $22–$55 for common dates; $1,500 for Wide Rim MS67[3][10].  \n- **Proof (PR70)**: Type 2 proofs reach $150–$4,380[4][7].  \n\n### Rarity and Demand  \n- The 1979-P Wide Rim comprises <0.01% of Philadelphia’s mintage, creating a 500% premium in MS63[10].  \n- Complete 1979-S proof sets with Type 2 coins command $175–$200[4][6].  \n\n---\n\n## Authentication and Identification  \n\n### Diagnostic Features  \n- **Wide Rim vs. Narrow Rim**: Measure the distance between the date and edge. Wide Rim dates appear “crowded”[7][10].  \n- **Mintmark Clarity**: Type 2 proofs exhibit a crisp “S” with visible serifs[6][7].  \n- **Edge Reeding**: 1979 dollars have 118 reeds, distinguishable from the quarter’s 119[2][5].  \n\n### Common Counterfeits  \n- Altered mintmarks on 1979-P coins to mimic the rare 1979-D[11].  \n- Electroplated fakes with added silver finish[15].  \n\n---\n\n## Market Trends and Pricing (2023–2025)  \n\n### Auction Highlights  \n- A 1979-P Wide Rim MS67+ sold for $6,500 in 2023[10].  \n- The 1979-S Type 2 PR70 DCAM fetched $4,380 in 2024[4][7].  \n\n### Price Guide (2025)  \n| Variety               | Circulated | MS63    | MS67    |  \n|-----------------------|------------|---------|---------|  \n| 1979-P Narrow Rim     | $1.10      | $5      | $165    |  \n| 1979-P Wide Rim       | $12        | $25     | $1,000  |  \n| 1979-S Type 2 Proof   | N/A        | $30     | $150    |  \n\n---\n\n## Acquisition and Sales Channels  \n\n### Reputable Dealers  \n- **PCGS/NGC-Certified Coins**: Ensure authenticity and grade accuracy[7][15].  \n- **Auction Houses**: Heritage Auctions and Stack’s Bowers specialize in error coins[12][15].  \n\n### Online Platforms  \n- eBay listings for raw coins average $3–$50, while certified specimens reach $1,000+[8][12].  \n- BullionSharks and Accurate Precious Metals offer curated collections[4][15].  \n\n---\n\n## Preservation and Care  \n\n### Storage Best Practices  \n- **Slabs**: NGC/PCGS holders prevent environmental damage[15].  \n- **Albums**: Acid-free pages with Mylar flaps reduce oxidation[15].  \n\n### Handling Guidelines  \n- Use cotton gloves to avoid transferring oils[15].  \n- Clean only with distilled water; abrasive tools risk scratching[11].  \n\n---\n\n## Conclusion  \n\nThe 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar’s value lies at the intersection of historical significance and numismatic rarity. While most remain face-value curiosities, discerning collectors target key varieties like the Wide Rim and Type 2 proofs, which encapsulate the coin’s complex legacy. As the U.S. Mint continues experimenting with dollar coins—from Sacagawea to the American Innovation series—the Anthony dollar serves as a cautionary tale and a tribute to pioneering women. Future research should explore its impact on subsequent coinage designs and its role in feminist numismatics.",
