  "content": "**People Also Ask (how much is a 1979 one dollar coin worth)**\n\n**1. Is a 1979 Susan B. Anthony Dollar Coin worth anything?**\n\n**Answer:** Yes, a 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar coin is worth something, although generally not a significant amount above its face value. In circulated condition, most 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollars are worth between $1.25 and $2.00. The exact value depends on its condition, mint mark, and any potential errors. Coins with very little wear and clear details will fetch a higher price.\n\n*   **Mint Marks:** The 1979 dollar was minted at Philadelphia (no mint mark), Denver (D), and San Francisco (S). The Philadelphia and Denver strikes are more common than the San Francisco ones.\n*   **Uncirculated Condition:** Uncirculated 1979 dollars (those that haven't been used in commerce) can be worth more, ranging from $3 to $10 depending on the grading service and the specific grade (MS60 to MS65).\n*   **Proof Coins:** Proof coins, minted specifically for collectors, are worth more. A 1979-S proof dollar in excellent condition can be worth $5 to $15 or more.\n*   **Error Coins:** Keep an eye out for error coins, which can be significantly more valuable. Examples include double-die errors or off-center strikes. These require careful examination and often professional grading to authenticate.\n\n**2. How can I tell if my 1979 dollar coin is valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the value of your 1979 dollar coin involves assessing several factors:\n\n*   **Condition:** This is paramount. Look for coins with minimal wear, sharp details, and original luster. \"Uncirculated\" coins (never used) are worth more. Use the Sheldon Grading Scale as a reference (though professional grading is best for precise assessment).\n*   **Mint Mark:** Check for a mint mark on the obverse (front) of the coin, near the bottom. No mint mark indicates Philadelphia, \"D\" indicates Denver, and \"S\" indicates San Francisco. San Francisco issues, especially proofs, are often more valuable.\n*   **Error Coins:** Examine the coin closely for any errors. Look for doubling of design elements, off-center strikes, or other anomalies. Error coins can be significantly more valuable than regular strikes. Consult a reputable coin grading service or numismatist for authentication.\n*   **Rarity:** While the 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar is not inherently rare, certain mint marks and conditions are scarcer than others. Research the mintage figures and survival rates for each mint mark to understand the potential rarity.\n*   **Professional Grading:** For potentially valuable coins, consider having them graded by a reputable service like PCGS or NGC. Grading provides an objective assessment of the coin's condition and authenticity, increasing its market value.\n\n**3. What is the mintage number for the 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar coin?**\n\n**Answer:** The mintage numbers for the 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar coin are as follows:\n\n*   **1979 (Philadelphia):** 360,222,000\n*   **1979-D (Denver):** 288,016,744\n*   **1979-S (San Francisco):** 2,758,000 (Proof)\n\nThese mintage figures are important because they provide context for the relative scarcity of each coin. The Philadelphia and Denver mints produced significantly more coins than the San Francisco mint, which only produced proof coins for collectors. This means that while circulated Philadelphia and Denver coins are common, uncirculated or exceptionally well-preserved examples, as well as the San Francisco proof coins, can command a higher premium. Knowing the mintage numbers helps collectors understand the availability of the coin in different conditions and mint marks, influencing its potential value.\n\n**4. How does the condition of a 1979 dollar affect its value?**\n\n**Answer:** The condition of a 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar coin is the single most significant factor influencing its value. Coin grading follows a scale from Poor (PO1) to Perfect Uncirculated (MS70), and the higher the grade, the more valuable the coin.\n\n*   **Circulated Coins:** Coins that have been used in circulation will show wear and tear. A coin in \"Good\" condition will have significant wear but still be identifiable. A coin in \"Fine\" condition will have moderate wear and some detail. \"Very Fine\" and \"Extremely Fine\" coins will have less wear and more detail. These circulated grades are generally worth only slightly above face value.\n*   **Uncirculated Coins:** Uncirculated coins (MS60-MS70) have never been in circulation and retain their original mint luster. These coins are worth significantly more. The higher the grade within the uncirculated range, the more valuable the coin. Look for sharp details, minimal imperfections, and original luster.\n*   **Proof Coins:** Proof coins are specially struck for collectors and have a mirror-like finish. Proof coins are graded on the same scale as uncirculated coins, but their pristine condition often commands a higher premium.\n\nProfessional grading by services like PCGS or NGC provides an objective assessment of a coin's condition, which is crucial for determining its accurate market value.\n\n**5. Where can I buy or sell a 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar coin?**\n\n**Answer:** There are several avenues for buying or selling 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar coins:\n\n*   **Coin Dealers:** Local coin shops are a good starting point. They can offer appraisals, buy coins outright, or facilitate sales on consignment. Look for reputable dealers with experience in US coinage.\n*   **Online Marketplaces:** Platforms like eBay and Amazon host numerous coin listings. Be cautious and thoroughly research sellers' reputations before purchasing. When selling, use high-quality photos and accurate descriptions.\n*   **Online Coin Auctions:** Websites specializing in coin auctions, such as Heritage Auctions or GreatCollections, can attract serious collectors and potentially yield higher prices, especially for rare or high-grade examples.\n*   **Coin Shows:** Attending coin shows allows you to interact with dealers and collectors in person, inspect coins closely, and negotiate prices.\n*   **Numismatic Clubs:** Joining a local or national numismatic club provides opportunities to learn about coins, connect with fellow collectors, and buy or sell coins within a trusted community.\n*   **Grading Services:** PCGS and NGC also have dealer networks and online marketplaces where you can buy or sell graded coins.\n\nWhen buying, always compare prices and examine the coin closely (or review high-resolution images). When selling, be realistic about the coin's value and consider the fees associated with each platform.\n\n**6. What are some common errors found on 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar coins?**\n\n**Answer:** While not exceedingly common, some errors have been found on 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar coins, making them potentially more valuable to collectors. Here are a few examples:\n\n*   **Double Die Obverse (DDO):** This occurs when the die used to strike the coin has been improperly hubbed, resulting in a doubling of the design elements on the obverse (front) of the coin. Look closely at the lettering and portrait for any signs of doubling.\n*   **Off-Center Strike:** This happens when the coin is not properly aligned during the striking process, resulting in the design being off-center. The more off-center the strike, the more valuable the error.\n*   **Broadstrike:** A broadstrike occurs when the collar (which normally confines the metal during striking) malfunctions, allowing the coin to spread out more than usual, creating a wider, flatter coin.\n*   **Clashed Dies:** This occurs when the obverse and reverse dies collide without a planchet between them, resulting in faint impressions of the opposite design on the coin's surface.\n\nIdentifying these errors requires careful examination and often the expertise of a numismatist or coin grading service. If you suspect you have an error coin, it's best to have it professionally authenticated to determine its value accurately.\n\n**7. Why were Susan B. Anthony dollar coins only minted for a few years?**\n\n**Answer:** The Susan B. Anthony dollar coin was only minted for a few years (1979-1981 and again in 1999) due to a combination of factors that led to its unpopularity and limited circulation:\n\n*   **Confusion with the Quarter:** Its size and color were too similar to the quarter dollar, leading to widespread confusion among the public, especially in vending machines and during transactions. People frequently mistook the dollar coin for a quarter, leading to frustration and rejection.\n*   **Public Resistance:** The public was generally resistant to using a dollar coin instead of a dollar bill. People were accustomed to the paper currency and found the coin inconvenient to carry.\n*   **Lack of Vending Machine Compatibility:** Many vending machines were not equipped to accept the new dollar coin, further limiting its usability.\n*   **Hoarding:** Many people collected the coin as a novelty item, taking it out of circulation.\n\nThe coin's limited minting and subsequent unpopularity contributed to its current value. While common in circulated condition, uncirculated examples and proof coins are more sought after by collectors due to their relative scarcity. The mint resumed production in 1999 only to deplete existing dies and meet demand before the introduction of the Sacagawea dollar coin in 2000, designed to be easily distinguishable from other coinage.\n",
