What makes an old piggy bank valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** The value of an old piggy bank is determined by a combination of factors, making accurate appraisal sometimes challenging. Rarity is a primary driver; the fewer examples of a particular bank that exist, the higher its potential value. This rarity can stem from limited production runs, manufacturing errors, or simply low survival rates. Material also matters. Cast iron banks, particularly those with intricate mechanical actions, often command higher prices than ceramic or plastic banks. Condition is paramount; a bank in excellent condition, with original paint and minimal wear, will be significantly more valuable than one that's chipped, rusted, or has been repainted. The manufacturer and designer play a role, with banks from renowned companies like J. & E. Stevens or Shepard Hardware often fetching premium prices. Finally, historical significance and subject matter can influence value. Banks depicting important historical figures, events, or popular cartoon characters tend to be more desirable to collectors. Consider seeking a professional appraisal for a comprehensive evaluation.\n\n**2. How can I identify an antique cast iron piggy bank?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying an antique cast iron piggy bank involves careful examination and research. Look for several key indicators:\n\n*   **Weight:** Cast iron is a dense metal, so authentic banks will feel substantial and heavy for their size.\n*   **Construction:** Examine the seams and closures. Old cast iron banks were often made using two or more pieces bolted or screwed together. Modern reproductions often use a single mold.\n*   **Paint:** Original paint tends to show signs of age, such as crazing (fine cracks), wear, and subtle color variations. Be wary of banks with pristine, glossy paint, as this could indicate a recent repaint. Use a magnifying glass to inspect the paint layers; original paint will often have multiple layers.\n*   **Markings:** Look for maker's marks or patent numbers, which can help identify the manufacturer and production year. These markings are usually located on the base or inside the bank. Consult reference books and online resources to decipher these markings.\n*   **Rust:** While excessive rust detracts from value, a light patina of rust is common on antique cast iron.\n*   **Action:** If it's a mechanical bank, test the mechanism. Does it function smoothly? A functioning mechanism is crucial for value.\n*   **Research:** Compare your bank to images and descriptions in reputable reference books or online databases dedicated to antique banks. Websites like WorthPoint or LiveAuctioneers can provide valuable information.\n\n**3. What are some of the most valuable old piggy banks?**\n\n**Answer:** Certain antique piggy banks are highly sought after by collectors and can command impressive prices. Some notable examples include:\n\n*   **J.& E. Stevens \"Speaking Dog\" Bank:** This mechanical bank, featuring a dog that appears to \"speak\" when a coin is deposited, is considered one of the most desirable and valuable. Examples in excellent condition can sell for tens of thousands of dollars.\n*   **Shepard Hardware \"Teddy and the Bear\" Bank:** Depicting President Theodore Roosevelt and a bear, this bank is highly collectible due to its historical significance and intricate design.\n*   **J.& E. Stevens \"Hall's Liliput\" Bank:** This mechanical bank features a small figure that shoots a coin into a target. Its complex mechanism and rarity contribute to its high value.\n*   **Kyser & Rex \"Roller Skating\" Bank:** This whimsical bank features two figures roller skating when a coin is deposited. Its unique design and relatively low production numbers make it valuable.\n*   **Early Glass Piggy Banks (pre-1900):** While less common, certain early glass piggy banks, particularly those with unique shapes or colors, can be valuable due to their fragility and scarcity.\n\nValues fluctuate based on condition and market demand, so consulting with an appraiser is recommended for accurate pricing.\n\n**4. Where can I find old piggy banks to buy?**\n\n**Answer:** There are several avenues for finding old piggy banks to purchase, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:\n\n*   **Antique Stores:** Local antique stores are a good starting point. They offer the opportunity to physically examine the banks before purchasing.\n*   **Online Auction Sites (eBay, LiveAuctioneers):** These platforms offer a vast selection and competitive bidding, but require careful research and due diligence to avoid scams or misrepresented items. Pay close attention to seller ratings and descriptions.\n*   **Estate Sales and Auctions:** Estate sales and auctions often feature collections of vintage items, including piggy banks. These can be a good source for finding hidden gems, but competition can be fierce.\n*   **Flea Markets and Yard Sales:** While more unpredictable, flea markets and yard sales can sometimes yield unexpected finds at bargain prices.\n*   **Specialized Antique Shows:** Antique shows dedicated to specific categories, such as toys or banks, are excellent places to find rare and valuable examples.\n*   **Online Dealers:** Websites specializing in antique banks offer curated selections and expert knowledge, but prices may be higher than on auction sites.\n\n**5. How can I clean and preserve an old piggy bank without damaging it?**\n\n**Answer:** Cleaning and preserving an old piggy bank requires a delicate touch to avoid causing irreparable damage.\n\n*   **Dusting:** Start by gently dusting the bank with a soft brush or microfiber cloth. Avoid using water or cleaning solutions at this stage.\n*   **Surface Dirt Removal:** For more stubborn dirt, use a slightly damp (not wet) cotton swab to gently wipe the surface. Test a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure the paint doesn't lift or fade.\n*   **Rust Removal (Cast Iron):** For minor surface rust, use a fine steel wool (grade 0000) and light machine oil (like 3-in-1 oil) to gently rub the affected areas. Be careful not to remove the original paint. For heavy rust, consider consulting a professional conservator.\n*   **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Never use harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or solvents, as they can damage the paint and metal.\n*   **Preservation:** Once cleaned, apply a thin coat of museum-grade wax to protect the paint and metal from further oxidation.\n*   **Storage:** Store the bank in a dry, stable environment away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Consider using acid-free tissue paper for wrapping.\n\n**6. What are some common reproductions or fakes of old piggy banks to watch out for?**\n\n**Answer:** The popularity of antique piggy banks has led to the proliferation of reproductions and fakes. Here are some common signs to watch out for:\n\n*   **New Paint:** Reproduction banks often have a new, glossy paint finish that lacks the patina and wear of original paint. The paint may also be applied unevenly or have a texture that doesn't match original examples.\n*   **Poor Quality Casting:** Reproductions may have rough edges, uneven surfaces, or visible casting flaws that are not present in authentic banks.\n*   **Missing Markings:** Many reproductions lack the maker's marks or patent numbers found on original banks.\n*   **Lightweight Construction:** Reproductions are often made from lighter materials than cast iron, such as pot metal or plastic.\n*   **Unusual Colors or Designs:** Be wary of banks with colors or designs that don't match known original examples. Consult reference books and online resources to verify authenticity.\n*   **Price Too Good to Be True:** If the price seems significantly lower than market value, it's likely a reproduction or fake.\n*   **Seams:** Look for seams that are welded together versus being bolted. This is often a tell-tale sign of reproduction.\n\n**7. How can I get an old piggy bank appraised?**\n\n**Answer:** Getting an old piggy bank appraised by a qualified professional is crucial for determining its accurate value. Here's how to proceed:\n\n*   **Identify a Qualified Appraiser:** Look for appraisers who specialize in antique toys, banks, or Americana. Membership in professional organizations such as the Appraisers Association of America (AAA) or the International Society of Appraisers (ISA) indicates a commitment to ethical standards and expertise.\n*   **Check Credentials and Experience:** Verify the appraiser's credentials, experience, and areas of expertise. Ask for references and examples of previous appraisals.\n*   **Inquire About Appraisal Fees:** Understand the appraiser's fee structure before proceeding. Fees may be based on an hourly rate, a percentage of the appraised value, or a flat fee.\n*   **Provide Detailed Information:** Provide the appraiser with as much information as possible about the bank, including its history, provenance (ownership history), condition, and any identifying marks.\n*   **Obtain a Written Appraisal:** Ensure that the appraiser provides a written appraisal that includes a detailed description of the bank, its condition, the appraisal methodology, and the estimated value.\n*   **Consider Multiple Appraisals:** For particularly valuable or rare banks, consider obtaining multiple appraisals to ensure accuracy. Remember that appraisal values can vary, so it's important to consider the opinions of multiple experts.\n",
