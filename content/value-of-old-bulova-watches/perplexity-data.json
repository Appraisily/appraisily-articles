  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query about the value of old Bulova watches. The user wants a comprehensive article covering several specific aspects. First, I need to understand each of the eight points they mentioned and how the provided search results can address them.\n\nStarting with the first point: what is the value and why it's important. From the sources, especially [4], [6], [9], and [13], I see that value depends on factors like rarity, age, materials, and historical significance. Bulova's history as a pioneer in watchmaking (source [2]) adds to their collectibility. It's important because these watches represent craftsmanship and innovation, making them desirable for collectors and investors.\n\nNext, historical background. Source [2] gives a timeline from 1875, highlighting milestones like the first radio commercial in 1926 and the Accutron in the 1960s. Mentioning these key events will show how Bulova's innovations contribute to their watches' value.\n\nFor types and variations, sources [1], [3], and [9] list different models like the Lone Eagle, military issues, and Accutron. Categories could be by era (1920s, 1930s), materials (solid gold, enamel), or special editions. Including examples like the 1920s Ladies' Sports Models or the President with Wandering Seconds from the 1930s would illustrate this.\n\nDetermining factors of value are covered in [4], [6], [9], and [13]. Rarity, condition, authenticity, model, and market trends are key. Specific examples like the 1940s military watches or enamel bezel ladies' models from [1] can be cited here.\n\nIdentifying authenticity involves checking serial numbers and movement codes, as per [5] and [11]. Also, materials and design consistency with the era, as mentioned in [9], are important. The user needs to know how to verify these details, maybe using resources like Watchophilia.\n\nMarket trends from [12] and [13] indicate growth in the watch market, with vintage pieces appreciating. The Accutron's resurgence and limited editions like the Joseph Bulova Collection (source [12]) are current trends. Pricing examples from [9] and [13] show ranges from $50 to $15,000, with celebrity-owned pieces fetching higher prices.\n\nBuying/selling venues include auctions (source [8], [10]), online platforms like 1stDibs (source [6]), and specialized dealers. Mentioning Bidsquare and Second Time Around Watch Co. from the sources would be relevant.\n\nMaintenance tips from [7] include regular servicing, avoiding magnets, and proper cleaning. Highlighting the need for professional overhaul every 3-5 years and using Polywatch for crystals adds practical advice.\n\nI need to structure all this into sections with headers, using specific examples and data points. Ensure each section cites the relevant sources, like [1] for collectible models or [9] for valuation factors. Avoid using markdown as per the user's request, but in the final answer, apply the correct formatting with headers and citations. Make sure the answer is comprehensive, covers all eight points, and flows logically from introduction to conclusion.\n</think>\n\nVintage Bulova watches hold significant value among collectors and horology enthusiasts due to their historical importance, craftsmanship, and connection to key moments in watchmaking history. Below is a structured analysis of their valuation and related factors:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding Bulova Watch Value  \nBulova watches gain value from their role in horological innovation (first standardized parts in 1923 [2], Accutron's tuning fork technology [8]) and artistic designs.

Valuation Factors  \n- **Rarity**: 1920s solid gold models [1] vs. common 1970s gold-plated ($100-$200) [9]  \n- **Condition**: Original dials/movements increase value 30-50% [4][6]  \n- **Provenance**: Celebrity-owned pieces fetch 10x average prices [13]  \n- **Materials**: Platinum/diamond models (e.g., 1930s $6,000 [9]) vs. stainless steel  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Authenticity Verification  \n- **Movement codes**: Pre-1950 watches use symbols (triangle = 1926 [5])  \n- **Case serials**: 1920s \"12\"/\"13\" prefixes vs. post-1950 2-letter date codes [5][11]  \n- **Design consistency**: Compare to decade-specific ads/archives [1][5]  \n- **Red flags**: Non-matching case/movement dates, replaced hands [5][11]  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Market Trends (2023-2025)  \n- **Growing demand**: Vintage watch market projected to hit $72B by 2025 [12]  \n- **Price surges**: 1940s rose gold models up 22% since 2020 [1][9]  \n- **Modern collectibles**: 2019 Computron reissues selling at 150% retail [12]  \n\n---\n\n## 7.

($925-$1,250 models [10])  \n- **Online**: 1stDibs (curated $200-$15,000 inventory [6])  \n\n---\n\n## 8. Preservation Guidelines  \n- **Servicing**: Complete overhaul every 3-5 years [7]  \n- **Storage**: Wind monthly to prevent oil drying [7]  \n- **Cleaning**: Use Polywatch for acrylic crystals [7]  \n- **Avoid**: Magnets (disrupt mechanical movements) [7]  \n\n---\n\nThis valuation landscape shows Bulova's enduring appeal, with strategic collecting focusing on pre-1950 complications, military models, and documented celebrity pieces. As the market grows, early authentication and preservation become critical to maintaining value.",
