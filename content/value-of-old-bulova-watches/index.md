Okay, let's tackle this query about the value of old Bulova watches. The user wants a comprehensive article covering several specific aspects. First, I need to understand each of the eight points they mentioned and how the provided search results can address them.

Starting with the first point: what is the value and why it's important. From the sources, especially [4], [6], [9], and [13], I see that value depends on factors like rarity, age, materials, and historical significance. Bulova's history as a pioneer in watchmaking (source [2]) adds to their collectibility. It's important because these watches represent craftsmanship and innovation, making them desirable for collectors and investors.

Next, historical background. Source [2] gives a timeline from 1875, highlighting milestones like the first radio commercial in 1926 and the Accutron in the 1960s. Mentioning these key events will show how Bulova's innovations contribute to their watches' value.

For types and variations, sources [1], [3], and [9] list different models like the Lone Eagle, military issues, and Accutron. Categories could be by era (1920s, 1930s), materials (solid gold, enamel), or special editions. Including examples like the 1920s Ladies' Sports Models or the President with Wandering Seconds from the 1930s would illustrate this.

Determining factors of value are covered in [4], [6], [9], and [13]. Rarity, condition, authenticity, model, and market trends are key. Specific examples like the 1940s military watches or enamel bezel ladies' models from [1] can be cited here.

Identifying authenticity involves checking serial numbers and movement codes, as per [5] and [11]. Also, materials and design consistency with the era, as mentioned in [9], are important. The user needs to know how to verify these details, maybe using resources like Watchophilia.

Market trends from [12] and [13] indicate growth in the watch market, with vintage pieces appreciating. The Accutron's resurgence and limited editions like the Joseph Bulova Collection (source [12]) are current trends. Pricing examples from [9] and [13] show ranges from $50 to $15,000, with celebrity-owned pieces fetching higher prices.

Buying/selling venues include auctions (source [8], [10]), online platforms like 1stDibs (source [6]), and specialized dealers. Mentioning Bidsquare and Second Time Around Watch Co. from the sources would be relevant.

Maintenance tips from [7] include regular servicing, avoiding magnets, and proper cleaning. Highlighting the need for professional overhaul every 3-5 years and using Polywatch for crystals adds practical advice.

I need to structure all this into sections with headers, using specific examples and data points. Ensure each section cites the relevant sources, like [1] for collectible models or [9] for valuation factors. Avoid using markdown as per the user's request, but in the final answer, apply the correct formatting with headers and citations. Make sure the answer is comprehensive, covers all eight points, and flows logically from introduction to conclusion.
