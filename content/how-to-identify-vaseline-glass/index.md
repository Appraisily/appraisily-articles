Okay, I need to create a comprehensive guide on how to identify Vaseline glass. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want detailed information covering eight specific aspects, from definition and historical background to market trends and care tips. 

First, I'll review the search results provided. The sources mention that Vaseline glass is uranium glass with a yellow-green color, glows under UV light, and has a history dating back to the 19th century. There's confusion between terms like Vaseline glass, uranium glass, and Depression glass. The key identifiers are the color, fluorescence under UV light, and sometimes radioactivity. 

For the historical background, sources indicate that production started in the 1830s, with Josef Reidel and others. The Manhattan Project affected uranium availability, halting production in the US. Companies like Fenton and Mosser are mentioned as modern producers. 

Different types include transparent Vaseline glass versus opaque varieties like custard glass. The value factors might include age, manufacturer, design, and uranium content. Authenticity can be checked via UV light and Geiger counters. 

Market trends from the sources show active auctions and a growing collector base. Pricing varies from affordable pieces to high-end items. Care tips involve gentle cleaning and avoiding harsh chemicals. 

I need to structure this into sections, each addressing the user's points. I'll start with a definition and importance, then move through history, types, value determinants, identification methods, market trends, buying/selling venues, and maintenance. 

I should ensure each section cites relevant sources. For example, the fluorescence test is mentioned in multiple sources, so I'll cite those. Historical production details come from sources [3] and [5]. Market examples from [9] and [11]. 

I need to avoid lists and use paragraphs, integrating examples naturally. Also, check that all eight user points are covered. Maybe combine some sections if they overlap, but the user specified eight, so I'll stick to that structure. 

Potential pitfalls: Confusing Vaseline with other uranium glasses, not clearly differentiating types, missing key identification methods. I'll make sure to clarify terms and provide specific examples. Also, ensure radiation safety is addressed, as some sources mention low levels but still important handling tips. 

Finally, the conclusion should synthesize the info and maybe touch on future trends, like eco-friendly alternatives mentioned in [13]. Make sure citations are correctly formatted with brackets. Alright, let's draft each section step by step, ensuring compliance with the report format and user instructions.

# Comprehensive Guide to Identifying and Understanding Vaseline Glass  

Vaseline glass, a captivating subset of uranium glass, has intrigued collectors and historians for over a century. Characterized by its distinctive yellow-green hue and fluorescent glow under ultraviolet (UV) light, this glassware derives its unique properties from uranium oxide additives. This guide explores its historical roots, identification methods, market dynamics, and preservation practices, offering a detailed resource for enthusiasts and scholars.

## 1. Definition and Significance of Vaseline Glass  

Vaseline glass is a type of **uranium glass** distinguished by its transparent yellow-green coloration, reminiscent of petroleum jelly (hence the name). Its value lies in its aesthetic appeal, historical craftsmanship, and scientific curiosity. The inclusion of **0.1–2% uranium oxide** not only imparts its signature glow under UV light but also links it to industrial and geopolitical narratives, such as its role in early nuclear research[1][3].  

Collectors prize Vaseline glass for its rarity and visual allure, while historians value it as a marker of 19th- and 20th-century glassmaking innovation. Its radioactivity, though minimal (emitting ~9–18 μrem/hr at 1 foot[1]), adds a layer of intrigue, making it a crossover interest for art and science enthusiasts.

## 2. Historical Development and Evolution  

The origins of Vaseline glass trace back to **1830s Bohemia**, where Josef Riedel pioneered uranium-infused glass under the names *Annagrün* (green) and *Annagelb* (yellow)[3][5]. By the 1840s, factories in France (Choisy-le-Roi) and England (Whitefriars) adopted the technique, popularizing it during the Victorian era. The term "Vaseline glass" emerged in the **1950s**, postdating the material’s peak production[1][6].  

Production halted during **World War II** when uranium was diverted for the Manhattan Project, but resumed in the 1950s with depleted uranium[1][13]. Notable manufacturers included **Fenton Art Glass**, **Mosser Glass**, and European firms like Baccarat, which blended uranium with opalescent agents to create milky variants[3][9].

## 3. Types and Variations  

Vaseline glass falls into several categories based on composition and appearance:  

- **Classic Vaseline Glass**: Transparent yellow-green with strong UV fluorescence. Examples include Victorian-era tableware and Art Deco vases[2][4].  
- **Custard Glass**: Opaque, creamy variants achieved by adding bone ash or tin oxide. Popular in early 20th-century American households[4][6].  
- **Burmese Glass**: Gradient-colored pieces blending uranium with heat-sensitive compounds, patented by Thomas Webb & Sons in 1885[3][15].  
- **Depression Glass**: Mass-produced during the 1930s, often with uranium content but distinct from true Vaseline glass due to added iron oxides[1][6].  

Modern reproductions, such as Mosser’s **Beaded Shell pattern**, mimic historical designs but often lack original uranium content[7][13].

## 4. Determinants of Value and Quality  

Key factors influencing value include:  

- **Age and Provenance**: Pre-1940s pieces command higher prices. A 1930s H. Hoffmann Art Deco vase, for example, sells for $200–$500[9].  
- **Manufacturer**: Brands like **Loetz Witwe** (Bohemia) and **Whitefriars** (UK) are highly sought after[15].  
- **Uranium Content**: Higher uranium concentrations (up to 2%) enhance fluorescence and desirability[1][4].  
- **Condition**: Chips or cracks reduce value. A mint-condition Fenton Love
