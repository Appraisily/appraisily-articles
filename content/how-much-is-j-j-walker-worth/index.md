Okay, I need to tackle this query about J.J. Walker's net worth and related aspects. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want a comprehensive article covering eight specific points, from the definition and importance of his net worth to market trends and preservation tips for memorabilia. 

First, I'll check the search results provided. There are multiple sources with varying net worth figures. Sources [1] and [4] mention $800k, [2] says $500k, and [3] and [8] suggest around $1.3 million. There's also confusion with golfer Jimmy Walker in [5], who has a much higher net worth. I need to clarify that Jimmie Walker (actor) and Jimmy Walker (golfer) are different people to avoid misinformation.

Next, the historical background. Jimmie Walker's career started in stand-up, then "Good Times" made him famous. His catchphrase "Dyn-O-Mite!" became iconic. Post-"Good Times," he continued acting and doing stand-up, which contributes to his income. Sources [13] and [15] provide details about his career and public perception versus his real personality.

For types of net worth, I should differentiate between his earnings from acting, stand-up, book sales, and memorabilia. Sources [6], [9], [10], [12], and [17] mention autographed items and memorabilia, which add to his value indirectly through collectibles.

Factors affecting his net worth include residuals from "Good Times," which might not be as lucrative as modern shows, his continued work in comedy, and personal financial decisions. Source [3] talks about his house sale and possible financial decisions impacting his net worth.

Identifying authentic memorabilia involves checking certifications like JSA (mentioned in [9] and [12]), acid-free materials ([18], [19], [20]), and avoiding forgeries. Market trends show that "Good Times" memorabilia is still popular, especially autographed photos and vintage dolls ([17], [7] mentions Eddie Murphy owning a painting from the show).

Where to buy/sell: eBay, specialized sites like Hollywood Memorabilia, and auctions. Care tips include UV protection, proper storage, and handling with gloves ([18], [19], [20]).

I need to structure all this into sections, cite sources properly, and ensure each part flows into the next. Also, clarify the confusion between the two Jimmy Walkers. Make sure to use the correct net worth figures, explain discrepancies, and discuss memorabilia's role in his overall financial landscape.

## 1. Understanding Jimmie Walker’s Net Worth and Its Significance  
Jimmie Walker’s net worth—estimated between **$500,000 and $1.3 million**[1][2][3][8]—reflects his decades-long career in comedy, television, and writing. While modest compared to modern Hollywood standards, his financial standing underscores the economic realities of actors from the 1970s, particularly those typecast after iconic roles. The value of his net worth extends beyond monetary metrics, encapsulating his cultural influence as a pioneer for African American representation in television[13][15].  

His net worth is significant for two reasons:  
1. **Historical Context**: It highlights the disparity between residual earnings for pre-1980s actors and modern counterparts. *Good Times* residuals, negotiated before syndication became highly lucrative, contribute minimally to his income compared to current standards[3][15].  
2. **Memorabilia Market**: Autographed photos, vintage dolls, and show artifacts (e.g., J.J.’s paintings) have become collectibles, indirectly amplifying his financial footprint[7][17].

## 2. Historical Background and Career Development  
Walker’s career began in New York’s stand-up comedy scene in the late 1960s. His breakthrough came in 1974 with *Good Times*, where his portrayal of J.J. Evans popularized the catchphrase “Dyn-O-Mite!” and made him a household name[13][15]. Despite the show’s success, Walker faced typecasting challenges post-*Good Times*, limiting his acting opportunities. He pivoted to stand-up comedy, film roles (e.g., *Airplane!*), and authored a memoir, *Dynomite!* (2012)[1][4].  

Key financial milestones:  
- **1974–1979**: Earned $15,000–$20,000 per episode for *Good Times*, a substantial sum at the time[15].  
- **1980s–2000s**: Sustained income through comedy tours and guest TV appearances[9][13].  
- **2010s–Present**: Revenue from memoir sales and nostalgia-driven memorabilia auctions[6][10][17].

2. **Material Quality**: Vintage dolls should have original packaging and functional sound mechanisms[17].  
3. **Provenance**: Auction houses like Christie’s or Heritage Auctions provide verified histories for high-value items[7].
