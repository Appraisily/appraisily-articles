Okay, I need to write a comprehensive guide on the value of the 1964-D Jefferson Nickel. Let me start by understanding the user's query. They want detailed information covering eight specific aspects, from historical background to current market trends. 

First, I'll review the provided search results. The PCGS and NGC links mention the high mintage of the 1964-D nickel but note its scarcity in high grades, especially with Full Steps. The CoinWeek articles discuss the historical context, like the coin shortage and the mint's response. The YouTube transcripts talk about repunched mint marks and errors adding value. 

For section 1, I need to explain what the 1964-D nickel is and why it's valuable. The high mintage is a key point, but despite that, high-grade specimens are rare. Sources [1], [2], and [9] highlight this. The importance lies in its historical significance as the last year before composition changes and the record mintage.

Section 2, historical background, should cover the 1964 coin shortage, the date freeze, and extended minting into 1965. Sources [2], [3], [7], and [9] provide this info. Mention the role of Mint Director Eva Adams and the impact on production numbers.

For types and variations (section 3), the main categories are regular strike, Full Steps, Specimen strikes, and errors like repunched mint marks or planchet errors. Sources [1], [4], [6], [10], and [12] discuss these. The SMS specimens from [2] and [6] are particularly rare.

Factors affecting value (section 4) include grade, Full Steps designation, mint errors, and strike quality. Sources [1], [2], [5], [6], and [9] emphasize grade and Full Steps. The PCGS and NGC grading standards are important here.

Identifying authentic coins (section 5) involves checking mint marks, steps on Monticello, and signs of wear. Sources [6], [8], and [11] mention grading services and visual inspection. Authentication through PCGS or NGC is crucial for high-value pieces.

Market trends (section 6) should reference recent auction results. Sources [6] and [12] note high prices for top-graded coins, like the $32,900 SMS specimen. The downward trend for some high-grade coins but spikes for errors.

Buying/selling (section 7) points to auctions, dealers, and online platforms. Sources [6], [8], and [11] suggest reputable dealers and grading services. Caution against counterfeits is needed, as mentioned in [6].

Preservation tips (section 8) include proper storage, handling, and avoiding cleaning. Sources [8] and [11] touch on maintaining condition to preserve value.

I need to structure all this into the report format with headers, avoiding lists and using citations properly. Each section should flow into the next, with examples and data from the sources. Make sure to cite each relevant source after sentences, using brackets. Check that all key points from the query are covered and that the information is accurate based on the provided search results.

# The Comprehensive Guide to the 1964-D Jefferson Nickel: Value, History, and Collectibility  

The 1964-D Jefferson Nickel holds a unique position in American numismatics. Despite having the highest mintage of any nickel in U.S. history (1.79 billion struck), it is paradoxically challenging to find in pristine condition, making high-grade examples highly sought after by collectors[1][2][9]. Its value ranges from face value for circulated specimens to over $32,900 for rare Special Mint Set (SMS) coins with Full Steps (FS) designations[6][12]. This report explores the historical context, varieties, grading factors, and market dynamics that define this iconic coin.

## 1. Historical Significance of the 1964-D Jefferson Nickel  

### The 1964 Coin Shortage and Date Freeze  
The 1964-D Jefferson Nickel was minted during a national coin shortage driven by the rising popularity of vending machines and toll systems, which hoarded circulating coinage[2][7]. To address this, Congress authorized a **date freeze**, allowing the U.S. Mint to continue striking 1964-dated nickels into 1965 and early 1966[2][9]. This resulted in the Denver Mint producing 1,787,297,160 nickels—a record unmatched until the late 1990s[7][9].  

### Transition Away from Silver  
While 1964 marked the final year for 90% silver dimes and quarters, the Jefferson Nickel retained its traditional composition of **75% copper and 25% nickel**[3][9]. This distinction positions the 1964-D as a bridge between the silver-based coinage of the early 20th century and the base-metal alloys adopted post-1965[3][7].

## 2. Varieties and Key Design Features  

### Standard Strikes vs. Special Strikes  
- **Regular Strike**: The majority of 1964-D nickels exhibit weak strikes due to overused dies, particularly in the steps of Monticello on the reverse[5][9]. Circulated examples are common, valued between $0.05 (face value) and $1.25[4][8].  
- **Full Steps (FS)**: Coins with five or six fully defined steps on Monticello’s entrance are rare. Only five MS66 FS examples are confirmed by PCGS, with auction prices reaching $4,250[1][6].  
- **Specimen Strikes (SMS)**: A mysterious subset of 1964 nickels, struck with polished dies on polished planchets, command premiums. An SMS SP68 FS specimen sold for $32,900 in 2016[6][12].  

### Mint Errors and Varieties  
- **Repunched Mint Marks (RPM)**: Doubled "D" mint marks, caused by misaligned die punches, are highly collectible. A 1964-D RPM graded MS65 sold for $6,000 in 2021[6][10].  
- **Off-Metal Strikes**: Examples struck on cent planchets (95% copper) exhibit a reddish hue and sell for $500–$1,000[4][6].  
- **Double Dies**: Blurred inscriptions like "IN GOD WE TRUST" appear on a small number of coins, elevating values to $200–$1,500 depending on severity[6][11].

## 3. Grading and Value Determinants  

### Condition and Preservation  
- **Circulated Grades (G–EF)**: Worn examples show flattened details on Jefferson’s cheek and Monticello’s steps. Values remain at face value to $0.50[8][11].  
- **Mint State (MS60–MS67)**: Uncirculated coins with minimal contact marks and full luster command premiums. An MS67 example sold for $3,960 in 2022, while MS66 grades trade for $23–$38[4][6].  
- **Full Steps Designation**: Coins with five or six fully defined steps add a 200–500% premium. MS65 FS specimens fetch $700, and MS66 FS examples reach $4,250[1][5].  

### Market Trends (2010–2024)  
- **Peak Prices**: The 1964-D SMS SP68 FS holds the record at $32,900 (2016), while regular MS67 FS coins peaked at $14,100 in 2014[6][12].  
- **Recent Declines**: High-grade FS coins have dipped due to market saturation. MS67 FS specimens now average $3,000–$4,000, down from $14,100 a decade ago[6][12].

## 4. Authentication and Identification  

### Key Authentication Features  
- **Mint Mark Placement**: The "D" mint mark is located to the right of Monticello on the reverse. Wartime nickels (1942–1945) placed mint marks above the building[3][9].  
- **Full Steps Criteria**: At least five distinct steps must be visible under 5x magnification, with no breaks or merging lines[2][6].  
- **Weight and Composition**: Authentic 1964-D nickels weigh 5.0 grams. Off-metal errors (e.g., struck on cent planchets) deviate to 3.1 grams[4][11].  

### Professional Grading Services  
Third-party grading by **PCGS** or **NGC** is critical for high-value specimens. For example:  
- A PCGS MS66 FS nickel sold for $4,250 in 2021, while raw examples in similar condition might fetch only $1,000[1][6].  
- NGC-certified SMS coins regularly outperform raw coins by 300–400% at auction[6][12].

## 5. Acquisition and Preservation Strategies  

### Sourcing 1964-D Nickels  
- **Auction Houses**: Heritage Auctions and Stack’s Bowers have sold 85% of top-tier FS and SMS specimens[6][12].  
- **Coin Dealers**: Reputable dealers like David Lawrence Rare Coins and Legend Rare Coin Auctions specialize in high-grade Jefferson nickels[8][11].  
- **Online Marketplaces**: eBay and GreatCollections list circulated examples for under $10, but buyers risk counterfeits without certification[4][8].  

### Preservation Best Practices  
- **Storage**: Use inert Mylar flips or NGC/PCGS holders to prevent toning and scratches[11].  
- **Handling**: Wear cotton gloves to avoid transferring oils to the coin’s surface[11].  
- **Cleaning**: Never clean coins, as abrasives destroy luster and reduce value by 50–90%[8][11].

## 6. Conclusion: The 1964-D Nickel’s Enduring Legacy  

The 1964-D Jefferson Nickel embodies a pivotal moment in U.S. minting history, bridging the silver era and modern base-metal coinage. While common in circulation, its numismatic value lies in exceptional strikes, rare errors, and pristine preservation. Collectors should prioritize certified examples and stay informed about market trends, as prices for top-graded specimens remain volatile. As the U.S. Mint’s most prolific nickel issue, the 1964-D continues to challenge and reward collectors seeking to uncover its hidden gems.
