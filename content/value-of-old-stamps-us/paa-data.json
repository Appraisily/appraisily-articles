How do I determine if my old US stamps are valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the value of old US stamps involves a multi-faceted approach. It's not as simple as just looking at the age. Several factors contribute to a stamp's worth:\n\n*   **Condition:** Stamps in pristine condition (no tears, creases, fading, or stains) are far more valuable than damaged ones. Look at the centering of the design on the stamp; well-centered stamps are more desirable.\n*   **Rarity:** Some stamps were printed in limited quantities or have errors (like printing mistakes). These rarities can command high prices. The Inverted Jenny, a 1918 stamp with an upside-down airplane, is a prime example and highly sought after.\n*   **Demand:** Collectors' preferences and trends influence value. Certain themes, historical periods, or even particular stamp designers might be more popular at a given time.\n*   **Gum:** The original gum (adhesive on the back) significantly impacts value. Stamps with original gum (especially never hinged – MNH) are generally worth more than those without gum. However, stamps with disturbed gum can be less valuable.\n*   **Scott Catalogue Number:** This is the standard reference for US stamps and provides a listing of all stamps with their catalog values. The Scott Catalogue is a great starting point, but remember it provides a *retail* value, not what you might receive selling the stamp.\n\nStart by consulting a stamp catalog like the Scott Catalogue. Then, compare your stamps to images online and in other reference materials. Consider getting an expert appraisal from a reputable stamp dealer for potentially valuable stamps.\n\n**2. What are some of the most valuable old US stamps?**\n\n**Answer:** While value fluctuates based on market demand and condition, some old US stamps consistently rank among the most valuable:\n\n*   **Inverted Jenny (C3a):** As mentioned earlier, this 1918 airmail stamp with the upside-down Curtiss Jenny biplane is incredibly rare and valuable. A single stamp can fetch hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars.\n*   **1847 5c Red Brown (Scott #2):** One of the first two stamps issued by the US Post Office. Fine examples with clear cancellations and good margins can be worth thousands.\n*   **1869 15c Pictorial Stamp (Scott #120):** This stamp features a landing of Columbus and is valuable in fine condition. Some varieties with specific grills (patterns embossed on the stamp) are even more desirable.\n*   **Z Grill (Scott #85A):** This stamp is extremely rare with only two known examples. One sold for nearly $1 million.\n*   **1861-66 1c Blue (Scott #73):** This stamp has many varieties and some are very valuable.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that *condition* is paramount. Even a generally valuable stamp in poor condition will be worth significantly less. Also, counterfeits exist, so authentication is important.\n\n**3. How does the condition of a stamp affect its value?**\n\n**Answer:** The condition of a stamp is arguably the *most* important factor determining its value. Collectors are willing to pay a premium for stamps in excellent condition because they are rarer and more aesthetically pleasing. Here's how different aspects of condition impact value:\n\n*   **Centering:** Well-centered stamps, where the design is evenly spaced within the perforations, are more desirable. Off-center stamps are less valuable.\n*   **Perforations:** Intact, undamaged perforations are essential. Missing or damaged perfs significantly reduce value.\n*   **Gum:** Original gum, especially never hinged (MNH), is highly valued. Hinged stamps (where a hinge was used to mount the stamp) are worth less. Stamps without gum (used stamps) are generally worth the least, unless they are of exceptional rarity.\n*   **Surface Condition:** Look for tears, creases, stains, fading, or any other damage to the stamp's surface. Even minor imperfections can decrease value.\n*   **Color:** Faded or discolored stamps are less desirable. Original, vibrant colors are a sign of good condition.\n\nGrading scales, like those used by professional grading services, help standardize the assessment of condition. Terms like \"Extra Fine,\" \"Very Fine,\" \"Fine,\" and \"Poor\" are used to describe the overall condition of a stamp. A difference of even one grade level can dramatically affect the price.\n\n**4. What is the Scott Catalogue and how does it help determine the value of old US stamps?**\n\n**Answer:** The Scott Catalogue is the industry-standard reference guide for identifying and valuing stamps worldwide, including those of the United States. It's a comprehensive listing that assigns a unique \"Scott number\" to each distinct stamp issue. It's published annually and updated with the latest market information.\n\nHere's how the Scott Catalogue helps determine stamp value:\n\n*   **Identification:** It provides detailed descriptions and images of each stamp, making it easier to identify the specific issue you have.\n*   **Listing of Varieties:** It lists different types of stamps, including errors, varieties (e.g., different watermarks or perforations), and re-issues.\n*   **Catalog Values:** The catalogue provides a \"catalog value\" for each stamp in various conditions (used, unused with original gum, never hinged).\n*   **Rarity Information:** While not always explicit, the catalog value often reflects the relative rarity of a stamp. Higher values generally indicate scarcer stamps.\n\n**Important Considerations When Using the Scott Catalogue:**\n\n*   **Retail Value:** The catalog value is a *retail* price – what a dealer might charge a collector. You likely won't get this price when selling your stamps.\n*   **Condition Matters:** The catalog value assumes a certain level of condition. Stamps in better or worse condition will be worth more or less, respectively.\n*   **Market Fluctuations:** Stamp values are subject to change based on market demand. The catalog value is a snapshot in time and may not reflect current prices.\n*   **Subscription Required:** It is recommended to have a current catalog to stay up to date.\n*   **Not a Guarantee:** The Scott catalog provides a good starting point, but professional appraisal is always recommended for valuable stamps.\n\n**5. Where can I sell my old US stamps?**\n\n**Answer:** There are several avenues for selling old US stamps, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:\n\n*   **Stamp Dealers:** Local stamp dealers can provide appraisals and purchase your stamps. They offer convenience, but you might not get the highest price. Research dealers' reputations and experience.\n*   **Auction Houses:** Auction houses (both online and traditional) can be a good option for valuable or rare stamps. They can reach a wider audience of collectors, potentially driving up the price. However, they charge commission fees.\n*   **Online Marketplaces:** Platforms like eBay, HipStamp, and Delcampe allow you to sell directly to collectors. This gives you more control over pricing, but requires more effort in listing, photographing, and shipping.\n*   **Stamp Shows:** Attending stamp shows can provide opportunities to meet with dealers and collectors. This allows for in-person appraisals and potential sales.\n*   **Consignment:** Some dealers or auction houses may offer consignment services, where they sell your stamps on your behalf and take a percentage of the sale.\n\nWhen choosing a selling method, consider the value and rarity of your stamps, your comfort level with online sales, and the amount of time and effort you're willing to invest. Get multiple appraisals before selling to ensure you're getting a fair price.\n\n**6. What are some common mistakes people make when trying to value their old US stamps?**\n\n**Answer:** Many people make common errors when assessing the value of their old US stamps, leading to inaccurate estimations:\n\n*   **Overestimating Condition:** People often overestimate the condition of their stamps. Small flaws that might seem insignificant can significantly reduce value.\n*   **Ignoring Perforations:** Damaged or missing perforations are a major detractor. Even if the stamp is otherwise in good condition, damaged perfs will lower the price.\n*   **Assuming Age Equals Value:** Just because a stamp is old doesn't automatically make it valuable. Many common stamps from the 19th and early 20th centuries are worth very little.\n*   **Relying Solely on Online Price Guides:** While online price guides can be helpful, they are often outdated or inaccurate. They don't always reflect current market trends or account for subtle variations.\n*   **Not Identifying Varieties:** Many stamps have different varieties (e.g., different watermarks, perforations, or colors). These varieties can significantly impact value, and failing to identify them can lead to an incorrect assessment.\n*   **Not Researching Reputable Dealers:** Selling to an unreputable dealer can lead to a low offer. Always research and vet potential buyers.\n*   **Cleaning Stamps:** Attempting to clean stamps can often do more harm than good, potentially damaging the stamp and reducing its value. Leave cleaning to professionals.\n\n**7. Where can I find more information about old US stamps and their value?**\n\n**Answer:** There are numerous resources available to expand your knowledge about old US stamps and their value:\n\n*   **The American Philatelic Society (APS):** The APS is the largest non-profit organization for stamp collectors in the world. They offer a wealth of information, including educational resources, expertizing services, and a library.\n*   **Stamp Catalogs:** The Scott Catalogue, as mentioned earlier, is the standard reference. Other catalogs, like the Brookman US Price List, can also be helpful.\n*   **Online Stamp Forums and Communities:** Websites like Stamp Community Forum and Stampboards offer platforms for collectors to share information, ask questions, and discuss stamp-related topics.\n*   **Stamp Collecting Books and Publications:** Numerous books and magazines are dedicated to stamp collecting. These resources can provide detailed information about specific stamp issues, historical context, and collecting techniques.\n*   **Local Stamp Clubs:** Joining a local stamp club can provide opportunities to meet with experienced collectors, learn from their expertise, and participate in stamp-related activities.\n*   **Museums:** Some museums have stamp collections on display or offer educational programs about philately. The National Postal Museum in Washington, D.C., is an excellent resource.\n*   **Reputable Stamp Dealers:** Consulting with reputable stamp dealers can provide valuable insights and guidance. Look for dealers who are members of professional organizations like the American Stamp Dealers Association (ASDA).\n",
