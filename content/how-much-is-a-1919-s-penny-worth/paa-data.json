  "content": "**People Also Ask (how much is a 1919 s penny worth)**\n\n**1. What factors determine the value of a 1919-S Lincoln penny?**\n\n**Answer:** The value of a 1919-S Lincoln penny, like any coin, is determined by several key factors. The most important is its condition, graded on a scale from Poor (heavily worn) to Mint State (uncirculated). A coin in \"Good\" condition will be worth significantly less than one in \"Extremely Fine\" or \"About Uncirculated\" condition.\n\n*   **Condition/Grade:** Higher grades mean sharper details and less wear, increasing value. Look closely at Lincoln's beard, hair, and the details of the wheat stalks on the reverse.\n*   **Rarity:** While the 1919-S had a relatively high mintage (41,930,000), it's still old and finding one in high grade can be challenging, increasing its value.\n*   **Errors:** Minting errors, such as double dies, off-center strikes, or planchet flaws, can significantly increase a coin's value, but are relatively rare.\n*   **Eye Appeal:** A coin's appearance, including its color and luster, plays a role. Original, uncleaned coins are generally more desirable.\n*   **Market Demand:** The overall demand for Lincoln pennies and specific mintmarks influences prices.\n\nUltimately, having a coin professionally graded by a service like PCGS or NGC will provide the most accurate assessment of its condition and potential value.\n\n**2. How can I identify a 1919-S Lincoln penny? What does the \"S\" mean?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying a 1919-S Lincoln penny is relatively straightforward. The key is locating the mint mark. The \"S\" indicates that the coin was struck at the San Francisco Mint. This mint mark is located on the obverse (front) of the coin, below the date and to the left of Lincoln's bust. If there is no mint mark in that location, it is not a 1919-S penny. It could be a 1919 penny (Philadelphia Mint) or a 1919-D penny (Denver Mint).\n\n*   **Location of the Mint Mark:** Look for a small \"S\" below the date.\n*   **Absence of Mint Mark:** If no mint mark is present, it's a 1919 penny minted in Philadelphia.\n*   **Distinguishing from \"D\" Mint Mark:** The Denver mint mark (\"D\") is also below the date, but it will be a clearly different letter.\n\nThe San Francisco Mint was established to help meet the growing demand for coinage on the West Coast, particularly following the California Gold Rush. The presence of the \"S\" mint mark not only identifies the coin's origin but also impacts its value. The 1919-S penny is generally more valuable than the 1919 Philadelphia penny in similar condition.\n\n**3. What is the estimated value of a 1919-S Lincoln penny in different conditions?**\n\n**Answer:** The estimated value of a 1919-S Lincoln penny varies greatly depending on its condition. Here's a general guideline, but remember that these are approximations and actual prices can fluctuate based on market conditions and specific coin characteristics:\n\n*   **Good (G4):** Typically worth around $1.00 to $2.00. The details are worn, but the date and mint mark are legible.\n*   **Very Good (VG8):** Valued at approximately $2.00 to $4.00. More details are visible, but still significant wear.\n*   **Fine (F12):** Generally fetches $5.00 to $10.00. Moderate wear, but key details are still clear.\n*   **Very Fine (VF20):** Can sell for $15.00 to $25.00. Details are sharp with moderate wear on high points.\n*   **Extremely Fine (EF40):** Worth $30.00 to $50.00. Sharp details with only slight wear on the highest points.\n*   **About Uncirculated (AU50):** Ranges from $60.00 to $100.00. Almost no wear, with some remaining luster.\n*   **Mint State (MS60+):** Can be worth $150.00 and up, depending on the specific grade and eye appeal. These coins have never been in circulation and retain their original luster.\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates. To get a precise valuation, consider consulting a reputable coin dealer or having the coin graded by a professional service.\n\n**4. Are there any rare or valuable errors associated with the 1919-S Lincoln penny?**\n\n**Answer:** While the 1919-S Lincoln penny doesn't have any widely known, highly publicized major errors like some other Lincoln cents, there are still possibilities for errors that can significantly increase its value. These are typically minor and require careful inspection.\n\n*   **Double Die Obverse (DDO):** This occurs when the die used to strike the coin is improperly made, resulting in a doubling of design elements. Look closely at Lincoln's portrait and the lettering for any signs of doubling. Even slight doubling can increase value.\n*   **Repunched Mint Mark (RPM):** This happens when the mint mark is punched into the die more than once, resulting in a slightly doubled or overlapping mint mark. This is less common but still sought after by collectors.\n*   **Off-Center Strike:** An off-center strike occurs when the coin is not properly positioned during striking, resulting in a portion of the design being missing. The value depends on the degree of off-centeredness.\n*   **Planchet Errors:** Errors relating to the metal blank (planchet) before striking can also occur, such as lamination errors or improperly mixed metal.\n\nIdentifying these errors requires a keen eye and often magnification. Consulting with a coin expert or submitting the coin to a grading service is recommended to confirm the error and determine its value.\n\n**5. What is the historical significance of the 1919-S Lincoln penny?**\n\n**Answer:** The 1919-S Lincoln penny holds a significant place in numismatic history as it was minted during a period of economic recovery following World War I. The San Francisco Mint played a crucial role in producing coinage to meet the demands of a growing economy.\n\n*   **Post-War Era:** The coin reflects the post-war economic landscape of the United States, a period of both growth and challenges.\n*   **Lincoln Cent Design:** The Lincoln cent, designed by Victor David Brenner, was introduced in 1909 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth. The 1919-S penny is part of this iconic series, representing a continuation of the design and its historical significance.\n*   **San Francisco Mint's Role:** The \"S\" mint mark reminds us of the importance of the San Francisco Mint in producing coinage for the Western United States, particularly during a time of expansion and development.\n*   **Collectible Value:** The coin's age and the fact that it's a relatively common but still sought-after issue contribute to its appeal among collectors. It serves as a tangible link to a specific year and place in American history.\n\nCollecting the 1919-S penny allows enthusiasts to connect with the past and appreciate the historical context in which it was created.\n\n**6. Where can I buy and sell 1919-S Lincoln pennies?**\n\n**Answer:** There are several avenues to buy and sell 1919-S Lincoln pennies, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:\n\n*   **Local Coin Shops:** Coin shops offer the benefit of in-person evaluation and negotiation. You can examine the coin firsthand and potentially get a better price than online.\n*   **Online Auction Sites (eBay, Heritage Auctions):** These platforms provide a wide audience and can potentially fetch higher prices, especially for higher-grade or error coins. Be sure to research comparable sales before listing.\n*   **Online Coin Dealers:** Reputable online coin dealers offer a convenient way to buy and sell. They often provide grading services and guarantees.\n*   **Coin Shows and Conventions:** These events bring together dealers and collectors, offering opportunities to buy, sell, and network.\n*   **Numismatic Organizations:** Organizations like the American Numismatic Association (ANA) can provide resources and connections for buying and selling coins.\n*   **Facebook Groups/Online Forums:** While these can be useful, exercise caution and verify the reputation of buyers and sellers.\n\nWhen buying, research the seller's reputation and ensure they offer a return policy. When selling, be realistic about the coin's condition and value, and consider having it graded to increase buyer confidence.\n\n**7. What are some common problems or challenges faced when collecting 1919-S Lincoln pennies?**\n\n**Answer:** Collecting 1919-S Lincoln pennies, while rewarding, can present certain challenges:\n\n*   **Identifying Genuine Coins:** While the \"S\" mint mark is a good indicator, counterfeit coins exist. Examine the coin carefully for authenticity, paying attention to the mint mark's shape and placement.\n*   **Determining Accurate Grading:** Grading can be subjective, and accurately assessing a coin's condition requires experience. Consider having valuable coins professionally graded.\n*   **Overestimation of Value:** Many people overestimate the value of their coins. Research comparable sales and consult with a dealer to get a realistic appraisal.\n*   **Cleaning Coins:** Cleaning a coin, especially improperly, can significantly reduce its value. It's generally best to leave coins as you found them.\n*   **Storage and Preservation:** Proper storage is crucial to prevent damage. Use acid-free holders or albums to protect your coins from environmental factors.\n*   **Finding High-Grade Examples:** While the 1919-S had a high mintage, finding examples in Mint State condition can be difficult and costly.\n*   **Fluctuating Market Values:** Coin values can fluctuate based on market demand and economic conditions.
