Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on online antique appraisals. Let's start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to ensure I cover everything thoroughly.

First, understanding what online antique appraisal is and its importance. From the search results, Prestige Estate Services and others mention that it's a digital process where experts evaluate antiques via photos. The importance lies in convenience, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility, especially for those who can't visit appraisers in person. Heritage Auctions and Skinner Auctioneers are examples that offer free evaluations, which adds value for users.

Next, the historical background. The search results don't explicitly mention the history, but I can infer that online appraisals grew with the internet's rise, particularly in the early 2000s. The development of digital photography and secure payment platforms likely facilitated this growth. Maybe mention how auction houses like Christie's started offering online services, as hinted in source [3].

Types of online appraisals: photo valuations, video consultations, and AI-driven tools. Sources like [1] and [15] mention photo submissions, while [16] talks about video conferencing. AI isn't directly mentioned, but it's a current trend, so I can include it as an emerging type.

Factors affecting value or quality: appraiser credentials (USPAP certification from [1]), photo quality ([6] emphasizes good images), item provenance, and market trends. Source [3] notes that paid appraisals are more accurate, which ties into quality determinants.

Identifying authentic services: Look for USPAP certification, check reviews (as in [5] where users recommend specific sites), transparency in pricing. Sources [12] and [15] mention certifications and professional affiliations.

Market trends: The shift towards remote services post-pandemic, integration of AI, and growth of niche platforms. Source [14] mentions platforms like WorthPoint and JustAnswer, indicating a trend towards specialized services.

Where to find services: Auction houses (Skinner, Heritage), specialized platforms (Value My Stuff, Antiqueappraisals.net), and online marketplaces (eBay, Ruby Lane). Sources [2], [5], and [14] provide examples here.

Care and maintenance tips: While the query mentions this for appraisals, it might be a mix-up. Since appraisals are services, perhaps the user meant care for antiques post-appraisal. Sources [7]-[11] and [13] discuss preserving antiques, so I'll link those tips here, like controlling humidity and proper cleaning.

I need to structure each section with headers, use examples from the sources, and cite appropriately. Make sure each section flows logically, covers all aspects, and integrates data points like USPAP certification, specific companies, and pricing models mentioned in the sources. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but ensure the final answer follows the format rules.
