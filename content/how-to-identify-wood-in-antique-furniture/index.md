Okay, I need to help the user by providing a comprehensive guide on how to identify wood in antique furniture. Let me start by breaking down each of their eight points to ensure I cover everything thoroughly.

First, understanding what identifying wood in antique furniture entails. From the search results, it's clear that this involves examining the wood type, grain, color, and construction techniques. The importance comes from determining age, origin, and value. Historical context is next. The French guild system in 1743 required marking furniture, which helps in identification, while British furniture often lacks marks. This historical background is crucial for understanding regional differences.

Next, different types or methods of identification. The sources mention checking maker's marks, wood grain patterns, joinery techniques, and finish types. For example, French antiques often have JME stamps, while British pieces might not. Also, looking at the tools used, like circular saw marks post-1860, helps date the piece.

Factors affecting value include the wood type—mahogany and walnut are more valuable. Construction quality, like hand-cut dovetails versus machine-made, also matters. Authenticity checks involve examining secondary woods used in hidden parts, which modern reproductions might not have. The market trends from 2025 indicate a rise in dark woods like walnut and mahogany, and the second-hand furniture market is growing, emphasizing sustainability.

Care and maintenance tips from the sources include avoiding harsh chemicals, using soft brushes for dusting, and proper waxing. Also, avoiding silicone and tung oil which can damage finishes. 

I need to structure each section with headers, include specific examples like the JME stamps, reference the growth of the second-hand market with the 2023 data, and mention the 7.7% CAGR. Case studies could include the mineral-replaced wood from Sudan, showing how advanced techniques are used. 

I should ensure each section flows logically, cites the relevant sources, and provides actionable advice. For instance, in identifying authentic pieces, checking for irregular dovetails and secondary woods. Also, mentioning the use of microscopes and databases as per the IAWA guidelines adds depth. 

Need to avoid any markdown in the thinking but make sure the final answer follows all formatting rules. Check that all eight user points are addressed with detailed subsections, using examples and data from the provided sources. Make sure citations are correctly applied after each relevant fact, like [1] for maker's marks and [8] for market size. 

Finally, wrap up with a summary that ties everything together, emphasizing the importance of wood identification in preserving history and ensuring value. Ensure the language is expert but accessible, avoiding jargon where possible. Double-check that all sections are covered and that each part of the user's query is fully addressed.

Identifying wood in antique furniture is a critical skill for collectors, historians, and enthusiasts. This process involves analyzing material characteristics, construction methods, and historical context to determine a piece’s age, origin, and value. Below is a structured guide to this multifaceted discipline.

---

## 1. **What Is Wood Identification in Antique Furniture?**  
Wood identification involves determining the species of wood used in antique furniture through visual, tactile, and sometimes microscopic analysis. This practice is valuable for:  
- **Authenticating age and provenance**: Certain woods correlate with specific eras (e.g., oak dominance pre-1700s, mahogany’s rise in the 18th century) [6][14].  
- **Assessing value**: Rare woods like calamander or kingwood command higher prices [6].  
- **Preserving historical accuracy**: Understanding materials aids in appropriate restoration [5][10].  

---

## 2. **Historical Background**  
- **Pre-18th Century**: Oak dominated European furniture due to durability. French guilds mandated maker’s marks (e.g., JME stamps for quality control) [1][6].  
- **18th–19th Century**: Mahogany and walnut became status symbols during the Chippendale and Empire periods [9][14].  
- **Industrial Revolution**: Machine-cut dovetails (post-1860) and standardized woods like pine emerged, contrasting with hand-planed surfaces of earlier eras [9][12].  

---

## 3. **Methods and Categories of Identification**  
### **Visual Analysis**  
- **Grain Patterns**:  
  - Oak: Prominent medullary rays and open pores [3][6].  
  - Mahogany: Straight, fine grain with minimal knots [3][14].  
  - Walnut: Wavy or curly grain with cooler tones [3][6].  
- **Color and Texture**:  
  - Cherry darkens with age; pine retains light hues and knots [2][11].  

### **Structural Clues**  
- **Joinery**:  
  - Hand-cut dovetails (uneven spacing) vs. machine-cut (uniform) [9][12].  
  - Circular saw marks (post-1860) vs. straight saw marks [1][9].  
- **Secondary Woods**: Cheaper woods like poplar in drawer linings indicate pre-20th-century construction [12][14].  

### **Scientific Techniques**  
- **Microscopic Analysis**: Endgrain examination under magnification reveals cellular structures (e.g., ring-porous vs. diffuse-porous) [7][10].  
- **Chemical Testing**: Shellac dissolves in denatured alcohol; milk paint reacts to ammonia [1][5].  

---

## 4. **Factors Influencing Value and Quality**  
- **Wood Rarity**: Exotics like kingwood or rosewood increase value [6][14].  
- **Craftsmanship**: Hand-carved details and mortise-and-tenon joints signal premium quality [9][12].  
- **Condition**: Original finishes (e.g., shellac) are preferable to refinishing [5][15].  
- **Provenance**: Maker’s marks (e.g., French estampilles) enhance authenticity [1][6].  

---

## 5. **Authenticity Verification**  
- **Check for Anachronisms**: A "mahogany" piece with plywood components indicates a modern reproduction [2][12].  
- **Patina**: Natural aging creates a mellow sheen; artificial distressing often lacks depth [15].  
- **Tool Marks**: Hand-planed surfaces show slight undulations, while machine-sanded wood is uniformly smooth [1][9].  
- **Case Study**: A 17th-century oak chest with hand-forged nails and wormholes in primary wood (not just secondary wood) confirms authenticity [10][12].  

---

## 6. **Market Trends and Pricing (2023–2025)**  
- **Demand**: The global second-hand furniture market reached $34 billion in 2023, driven by sustainability trends [8].  
- **Pricing Examples**:  
  - Georgian mahogany tables: $2,000–$10,000+ depending on condition [14].  
  - Arts and Crafts oak pieces: $500–$5,000 [6].  
- **Trends**: Dark woods (walnut, mahogany) and Art Deco styles are resurgent [4][14].  

---

## 7. **Sourcing and Selling Channels**  
- **Acquisition**:  
  - Auction houses (e.g., Sotheby’s) for high-end antiques.  
  - Online platforms (Chairish, 1stDibs) for mid-range pieces [8][15].  
- **Selling Tips**:  
  - Highlight wood type and provenance in listings.  
  - Use UV-light inspections to detect undocumented repairs [5][10].  

---

## 8. **Preservation and Care**  
- **Cleaning**: Use soft brushes for dusting; avoid silicone-based polishes [5][15].  
- **Environment**: Maintain 40–60% humidity to prevent warping [5].  
- **Repairs**: Use reversible methods (e.g., hide glue) to retain value [5][10].  
- **Storage**: Elevate furniture off damp floors; shield from direct sunlight [5][14].  

---

## Conclusion  
Mastering wood identification requires combining observational skills, historical knowledge, and scientific tools. As the second-hand furniture market grows, this expertise becomes increasingly vital for preserving cultural heritage and making informed acquisitions. By analyzing grain, joinery, and provenance, collectors can uncover stories embedded in each piece, ensuring their longevity for future generations.
