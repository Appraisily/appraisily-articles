  "content": "**People Also Ask (how much is a penny from 1904 worth)**\n\n**1. What factors determine the value of a 1904 penny?**\n\n**Answer:** The value of a 1904 penny, specifically a Lincoln cent, is influenced by several key factors. The primary driver is its condition, graded on a scale from Poor to Mint State (MS). A heavily worn coin in Poor condition will be worth significantly less than one in MS condition. Rarity also plays a crucial role. The Philadelphia Mint struck 140,737,643 1904 pennies, making them relatively common. However, the San Francisco Mint produced only 6,270,000 coins, marked with an \"S\" mint mark under the date. These \"S\" mint pennies are scarcer and command a higher premium.\n\n*   **Condition:** This is paramount. Collectors seek coins with minimal wear, strong details, and original luster.\n*   **Mint Mark:** The presence or absence of a mint mark (\"S\" for San Francisco) significantly impacts value.\n*   **Errors and Varieties:** Any errors during the minting process, such as doubled dies or off-center strikes, can dramatically increase value.\n*   **Demand:** Collector interest in Lincoln cents and specific dates influences market prices.\n*   **Third-party grading:** Coins graded and encapsulated by reputable services like PCGS or NGC command higher prices due to guaranteed authenticity and condition.\n\nTherefore, assessing a 1904 penny's value requires a careful evaluation of these factors.\n\n**2. How can I identify a 1904-S penny and why is it more valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying a 1904-S penny is straightforward. The key is to look for a small \"S\" mint mark located below the date on the obverse (front) of the coin. This mint mark signifies that the coin was struck at the San Francisco Mint. If there is no mint mark, the coin was minted in Philadelphia, which produced a much larger quantity of 1904 pennies.\n\nThe 1904-S penny is significantly more valuable than the 1904 penny minted in Philadelphia due to its lower mintage. With only 6,270,000 coins produced in San Francisco compared to over 140 million in Philadelphia, the 1904-S penny is considerably scarcer. This scarcity drives up its value, particularly in higher grades (better condition).\n\n*   **Location of Mint Mark:** Always check for the \"S\" mint mark below the date.\n*   **Mintage Figures:** Remember the significant difference in mintage numbers between the two mints.\n*   **Authentication:** Be wary of counterfeit \"S\" mint marks added to Philadelphia pennies. Consult a reputable coin dealer or grading service if you're unsure.\n\nEven in circulated conditions, a 1904-S penny will typically be worth more than a Philadelphia-minted coin of the same grade.\n\n**3. What is the approximate value of a 1904 penny in different conditions (Good, Fine, Uncirculated)?**\n\n**Answer:** The approximate value of a 1904 penny varies drastically depending on its condition. Hereâ€™s a general guide, but remember that market prices fluctuate:\n\n*   **Good (G):** This means the coin is heavily worn but the major design elements are still visible. A 1904 penny in Good condition is generally worth around $1 - $2.\n*   **Fine (F):** Some details are visible, but there is moderate wear. Expect to see some flattening of the higher points of the design. A 1904 penny in Fine condition might be worth $3 - $5.\n*   **Very Fine (VF):** The coin has moderate wear, with more detail visible than in Fine condition. Key details like Lincoln's beard and hair are still relatively sharp. A 1904 penny in Very Fine condition could fetch $7 - $12.\n*   **Extremely Fine (EF):** The coin has only slight wear on the highest points of the design. Most details are sharp. An Extremely Fine 1904 penny could be worth $15 - $30.\n*   **Uncirculated (MS):** These coins show no signs of wear and retain their original mint luster. The value of an uncirculated 1904 penny depends on the specific grade (MS60 to MS70). A common grade like MS63 might be worth $40 - $80, while a higher grade like MS65 or above could be worth hundreds of dollars.\n\nFor a 1904-S penny, add a significant premium to these values, especially in higher grades. Always consult a current coin price guide or a reputable coin dealer for the most up-to-date pricing.\n\n**4. Are there any rare or valuable errors associated with the 1904 penny?**\n\n**Answer:** While the 1904 penny is generally not considered a rare coin in terms of mintage figures, certain errors and varieties can significantly increase its value. Keep in mind that authenticating errors requires expertise.\n\n*   **Doubled Die Obverse (DDO):** In a doubled die error, the design elements on the obverse (front) of the coin appear doubled. This is caused by a misalignment during the die-making process. While not widely documented for the 1904 specifically, it's worth examining your coin closely for any signs of doubling, particularly on Lincoln's features or the lettering. If found, compare it to known DDO examples for other Lincoln cents.\n*   **Off-Center Strike:** An off-center strike occurs when the coin is not properly aligned during the striking process, resulting in a portion of the design being missing. The value depends on the percentage of the design that is off-center. A coin with a significant portion of the design missing can be quite valuable.\n*   **Planchet Errors:** These errors involve the metal blank (planchet) itself. Examples include planchets that are too thin or too thick, or made from the wrong metal. These are less common.\n\nIf you suspect your 1904 penny has an error, consult with a reputable coin dealer or submit it to a professional grading service like PCGS or NGC for authentication and grading.\n\n**5. What's the best way to store and protect a 1904 penny to preserve its value?**\n\n**Answer:** Proper storage and handling are crucial for preserving the value of your 1904 penny. Avoid touching the coin directly with your bare hands, as oils and acids from your skin can damage the surface and reduce its value.\n\n*   **Handling:** Always hold the coin by its edges.\n*   **Storage:**\n    *   **Individual Coin Holders:** These are inexpensive and offer good protection. Opt for holders made of inert materials like Mylar or archival-quality plastic.\n    *   **Coin Albums or Folders:** These are convenient for organizing and displaying your collection. Ensure the albums are made of acid-free materials.\n    *   **Graded Coin Slabs:** If your coin is graded by PCGS or NGC, it will be encapsulated in a protective slab. Do not attempt to remove the coin from the slab.\n*   **Environment:** Store your coins in a cool, dry place with stable temperature and humidity. Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause discoloration. Attics and basements are generally not suitable due to temperature and humidity fluctuations.\n*   **Cleaning:** *Never* clean your coins. Cleaning can remove the original surface and significantly reduce their value.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can help protect your 1904 penny and preserve its value for years to come.\n\n**6. Where can I buy or sell a 1904 penny?**\n\n**Answer:** There are several avenues for buying or selling a 1904 penny, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:\n\n*   **Local Coin Shops:** Coin shops are a great starting point for both buying and selling. They offer the opportunity to examine coins in person and get expert advice. However, prices may vary.\n*   **Coin Shows:** Coin shows are events where dealers and collectors gather to buy, sell, and trade coins. They offer a wide selection and competitive prices.\n*   **Online Auctions (eBay, Heritage Auctions):** Online auctions can reach a large audience, potentially resulting in higher prices, especially for rare or high-grade coins. However, be cautious of scams and always research the seller's reputation. Heritage Auctions is a good option for high-value coins.\n*   **Online Coin Dealers:** Reputable online coin dealers offer a convenient way to buy and sell coins. They often have detailed grading information and secure payment options.\n*   **Numismatic Clubs:** Joining a local numismatic (coin collecting) club can provide access to fellow collectors and dealers, offering opportunities to buy, sell, and learn more about coins.\n\nWhen selling, be realistic about the condition and value of your coin. When buying, do your research and compare prices from multiple sources before making a purchase.\n\n**7. What is the historical context surrounding the production of the 1904 penny?**\n\n**Answer:** The 1904 Lincoln cent was minted during a period of significant economic and social change in the United States. Theodore Roosevelt was president, and the country was experiencing rapid industrialization and westward expansion. The Lincoln cent itself was still relatively new, having been introduced in 1909 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth, replacing the Indian Head cent.\n\n*   **Economic Conditions:** 1904 was a year of relative economic stability following the Panic of 1907. This stability contributed to the large mintage of pennies in Philadelphia.\n*   **The Lincoln Cent's Design:** Victor David Brenner designed the Lincoln cent, featuring a portrait of Lincoln on the obverse and wheat stalks on the reverse. This design was a departure from previous U.S. coinage and reflected a growing appreciation for Lincoln's legacy.\n*   **San Francisco Mint's Role:** The San Francisco Mint played a vital role in producing coinage for the Western United States, serving the needs of a growing population and economy. The lower mintage of the 1904-S penny reflects the specific demands of the region at that time.\n\nUnderstanding the historical context surrounding the production of the 1904 penny can enhance your appreciation for this piece of American history and its place within the broader narrative of the United States. The story behind the coin adds to its value beyond just its metal content.\n",
