Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on the value of old Singer sewing machines in wood cabinets. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's eight points and see how the provided search results can inform each section.

First, understanding what makes these machines valuable. From search result 6, it mentions factors like age, condition, rarity, and desirability. Also, the historical significance from result 2 about Singer being a major furniture manufacturer adds context. The wood types (oak, mahogany) in result 6 and 9 are important for value. Collectibility and sentimental value are also noted there.

Next, historical background. Result 2 is key here, detailing Singer's history as a furniture maker, their mass production techniques, and the use of veneers. Result 9 also gives some history on cabinet styles and evolution from treadle machines. I should tie in how the company's innovations impacted cabinet production and design.

Types and variations: Result 8 lists various cabinet models (No. 40, Queen Anne, etc.) and compatible Singer machines. Result 9 mentions different styles like Queen Anne and Art Deco, and materials like oak and walnut. Also, result 12 shows different models for sale, indicating variety in the market.

Factors determining value: Result 6 lists age, condition, completeness, and desirability. Result 12's pricing examples show how model and condition affect price. Rarity from result 6 and 12 (specific models fetching higher prices) is a factor. The presence of original accessories (result 6) and cabinet style (result 9) also matter.

Identifying authentic pieces: Result 4 and 11 discuss using serial numbers to date machines, which helps in authentication. Result 8's list of models and cabinets can help cross-reference. Physical characteristics like logos (result 9) and construction details (veneer thickness in result 1) are clues. Result 11's visual guide helps spot genuine models.

Market trends: Result 3 mentions the sewing machine market growth, but for vintage, result 6 and 12 show prices ranging from $50 to $1,500+. Result 12's eBay listings give current price examples. The collectibility trend from result 6 and 9's mention of enthusiast communities indicates sustained interest.

Buying/selling venues: Result 12 lists eBay, Etsy, and antique stores. Result 13's forum suggests local auctions and specialized dealers. Restoration services (result 10) might also be a source.

Care and maintenance: Result 1 and 5 discuss using Howard's products, wood glue for veneer, and avoiding over-cleaning. Result 10's restoration case study offers tips on dealing with water damage. Result 7 has maintenance tips like oiling and cleaning. Avoiding harsh chemicals (result 1) and using wax (result 5) are important.

I need to organize all this into sections, cite the sources appropriately, and ensure each part is comprehensive. Also, check for any missing points or additional details from the search results that could enhance each section. Make sure to include specific examples like model numbers, price ranges, and care products mentioned.

## 5. Identifying Authentic Pieces

- **Logo details**: Early cabinets feature scrollwork or “Singer Sewing Machines” embossing[9].  
- **Construction**: Look for dovetail joints, cast-iron hinges, and thick veneers[1][2].

## 6. Market Trends and Pricing

---

## 8. Preservation and Care Tips  
- **Cleaning**: Use Howard’s Restore-A-Finish for minor scratches and Feed-N-Wax for protection[1][5].  
- **Veneer repair**: Secure loose sections with carpenter’s glue and clamps[1].  
- **Metal maintenance**: Remove rust with brass brushes; avoid repainting treadles to preserve patina[1].
