    "prompt": "Photorealistic medium shot focusing on the hands of an expert antique book appraiser, wearing white cotton gloves, carefully turning the fragile page of a large, centuries-old, leather-bound tome laid open on a dark wood table. A classic brass magnifying glass rests nearby. The background shows a softly blurred, scholarly library setting with bookshelves. Lighting is warm and focused, perhaps from a desk lamp, highlighting the textures of the aged paper, worn leather, and gilded lettering on the spine. Shallow depth of field emphasizes the book and hands. Professional, detailed style. --ar 16:9",

    "prompt": "A wide-angle photorealistic view inside a professional book appraiser's workshop or office. Tall, dark wood shelves packed with antique books line the back wall. In the mid-ground, an appraiser sits at a large desk examining a stack of diverse antique books – some with elaborate bindings, others simple pamphlets. Tools like reference guides, measuring tapes, and conservation supplies are neatly arranged on the desk. Natural light streams in from a large window to the left, illuminating the scene with soft, diffused light. Deep focus captures the environment and the variety of books undergoing appraisal. Clean, organized, expert atmosphere. --ar 16:9",

    "prompt": "Extreme close-up, macro photography style, focusing on a specific valuable detail of an antique book being appraised. Capture the intricate gold tooling on a leather spine, a rare printer's mark on a title page, or a hand-colored illustration. The texture of the aged paper, the richness of the ink, and any imperfections like foxing should be hyper-realistic. Lighting is dramatic and directional, perhaps side-lit, to emphasize the three-dimensional quality and texture of the detail. Very shallow depth of field blurs the surrounding area, drawing the eye solely to the appraised feature. --ar 16:9",
