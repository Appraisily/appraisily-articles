Okay, let's tackle this query about antique book appraisals. The user wants a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects. First, I need to go through each of the search results provided to gather relevant information. 

Starting with the first point: What is antique book appraisal and its importance. From sources [1] and [2], I see that appraisals are evaluations by qualified professionals to determine market value, used for insurance, sales, legal matters, etc. Importance includes establishing value for insurance, estate planning, and authenticity verification. 

Next, historical background. Source [12] mentions the antiquarian book trade in the US dating back to Colonial times, with Boston being an early hub. The shift to Philadelphia and New York in the 18th century, expansion westward. This gives a timeline for the development of appraisals as part of the trade.

Types of appraisals: Sources [1] and [2] mention insurance, estate, donation, and auction appraisals. Each serves different purposes, like fair market value vs. replacement value.

Factors affecting value: Multiple sources ([3], [5], [9], [10]) list condition, rarity, edition (especially first editions), provenance, author significance, and market demand. Condition grading from [4] (As New to Poor) is crucial here.

Identifying authentic appraisals: Source [13] talks about checking publisher marks, number lines, and professional authentication. Also, [8] mentions conservation surveys and expert evaluations. Need to emphasize certifications like ISA or ABAA.

- Authenticates historical significance for cultural institutions  
- Provides legal documentation for ownership disputes[1]  

Case Study: A 1623 First Folio of Shakespeare’s works appraised at $9.8M in 2020 required provenance verification through marginalia analysis and chain-of-ownership documentation[12].
