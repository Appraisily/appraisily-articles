What is ivory, and what are its key characteristics that distinguish it from similar materials?**\n\n**Answer:** Ivory, traditionally, refers to the teeth and tusks of certain mammals, primarily elephants, but also hippopotamuses, walruses, and narwhals. Its key characteristic is its composition: primarily dentine, a dense, hard, bone-like tissue. Distinguishing ivory requires careful observation of several features:\n\n*   **Schreger lines:** These are cross-hatched lines visible on the cross-section of elephant ivory tusks. The angle of these lines (greater than 115 degrees for true elephant ivory) and their pattern are crucial for identification. Mammoth ivory also has Schreger lines, but they are typically tighter and more acute (less than 90 degrees).\n*   **Grain and Texture:** Ivory exhibits a subtle, creamy grain, often described as \"engine turning\" or \"basket weave.\" This grain is visible under magnification.\n*   **Color:** Fresh ivory is typically a creamy white, but it yellows with age due to oxidation and absorption of oils. However, color alone is not a reliable indicator, as staining and artificial aging are common.\n*   **Density:** Ivory is relatively dense, typically around 1.7 to 1.85 g/cm3. While helpful, this requires destructive testing or comparing the weight of similar-sized objects.\n*   **Feel:** Ivory often feels cool and smooth to the touch.\n\nMaterials often mistaken for ivory include bone, horn, vegetable ivory (tagua nut), and plastics (celluloid, casein, and modern polymers). Bone, for example, has a more porous structure and lacks Schreger lines. Plastics often appear too perfect and lack the natural variations found in genuine ivory.\n\n**2. How can I tell the difference between elephant ivory and mammoth ivory?**\n\n**Answer:** Differentiating between elephant and mammoth ivory requires careful examination, often aided by magnification. While both are ivory, their age and origin create distinct characteristics:\n\n*   **Schreger Lines:** This is the most reliable method. As mentioned above, elephant ivory has Schreger lines with angles exceeding 115 degrees, while mammoth ivory typically has angles less than 90 degrees. This is measured on a cross-section of the tusk. If the item is carved, this measurement can be difficult to impossible to obtain.\n*   **Color and Patina:** Mammoth ivory, having been buried for thousands of years, often exhibits a stained or patinated surface. Colors can range from creamy white to brown, blue, or even black due to mineral absorption from the soil. Elephant ivory, while aging to yellow, is less likely to have such dramatic coloration unless artificially stained.\n*   **Cracks and Fissures:** Mammoth ivory is often more brittle and prone to cracking due to its age and exposure to environmental factors. This is not a definitive indicator, as elephant ivory can also crack with age and improper care.\n*   **Odor:** Some experts claim that mammoth ivory can have a faint earthy or musty odor when heated or rubbed vigorously. This is not a reliable test, and should not be performed on valuable pieces.\n*   **Radiocarbon Dating:** For definitive identification, especially in cases of legal dispute or high-value items, radiocarbon dating can be used to determine the age of the ivory. Mammoth ivory will date back thousands of years, while elephant ivory will be relatively recent.\n\nIt's important to note that the legal status of mammoth ivory differs from that of elephant ivory in many jurisdictions.\n\n**3. What are some simple at-home tests I can use to identify ivory?**\n\n**Answer:** While professional authentication is always recommended for valuable items, several simple at-home tests can provide preliminary clues, although none are foolproof:\n\n*   **The Hot Needle Test (Use with extreme caution!):** This test involves heating a needle and pressing it against an inconspicuous area of the object. If it's plastic, it will likely melt and emit a plastic odor. Ivory will resist melting and may emit a slight burning hair smell. **Important:** This test can damage the object and should only be performed as a last resort on an area that is not visible.\n*   **The Shine Test:** Ivory has a unique soft, warm shine, almost oily in appearance, due to its composition. Plastics often have a harder, more reflective shine. Compare the object's shine to known examples of ivory and plastic.\n*   **Magnification:** Use a magnifying glass or jeweler's loupe to examine the surface. Look for the \"engine turning\" or \"basket weave\" grain pattern characteristic of ivory. Bone will typically have a more porous and grainy texture.\n*   **Tap Test:** When tapped against a hard surface, ivory produces a distinct high-pitched ringing sound. Plastic tends to produce a duller thud. This is subjective and requires practice.\n*   **UV Light Test:** Under ultraviolet (UV) light, some ivory can fluoresce with a bluish-white or yellowish-white glow. However, this is not definitive, as some plastics and other materials can also fluoresce.\n\n**Disclaimer:** These tests are not conclusive and can potentially damage the object. If you suspect you have ivory, consult with a qualified appraiser or expert for professional authentication.\n\n**4. How does the price of ivory vary, and what factors influence its value?**\n\n**Answer:** The price of ivory is highly variable and influenced by a complex interplay of factors:\n\n*   **Type of Ivory:** Elephant ivory typically commands a higher price than other types, such as walrus or hippo ivory, due to its larger size and historical significance. Mammoth ivory can also be valuable, especially well-preserved pieces.\n*   **Age and Condition:** Older pieces, particularly antiques in excellent condition, tend to be more valuable. Cracks, chips, and staining can significantly reduce the price.\n*   **Size and Quality:** Larger, more uniformly colored pieces of ivory are generally more desirable.\n*   **Carving Quality and Artistry:** Intricately carved pieces by known artists or workshops are highly sought after. The skill and detail of the carving are major determinants of value.\n*   **Provenance and History:** An item's documented history and ownership (provenance) can significantly increase its value, particularly if it's associated with a notable person or event.\n*   **Legal Status:** The legality of buying and selling ivory varies widely by jurisdiction. Items with documented pre-ban origin (before the 1970s for elephant ivory in many countries) are generally legal to trade, but strict regulations apply. Illegal ivory has little to no value and can result in severe penalties.\n*   **Market Demand:** Current trends and collector preferences also influence prices. Certain types of ivory carvings, such as netsuke or okimono, may be more in demand at certain times.\n\nDue to legal complexities and ethical concerns, the ivory market is often opaque and subject to fluctuations. It is crucial to research local laws and regulations before buying or selling any item suspected of being ivory.\n\n**5. What are the legal implications of owning, buying, or selling ivory?**\n\n**Answer:** The legal landscape surrounding ivory is complex and varies significantly depending on the country and even local jurisdiction. Generally speaking, international trade in elephant ivory is heavily restricted under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Many countries have implemented stricter regulations than CITES, including outright bans on the sale of all ivory, regardless of age.\n\nKey legal considerations include:\n\n*   **CITES Regulations:** CITES regulates international trade in endangered species, including elephants. Trade in elephant ivory is generally prohibited unless the ivory was acquired before CITES regulations were implemented (pre-ban ivory) and is accompanied by proper documentation.\n*   **National Laws:** Many countries have their own laws regarding ivory. The United States, for example, has the Endangered Species Act, which restricts the import, export, and interstate sale of elephant ivory. Some states within the US have even stricter laws, banning the sale of almost all ivory.\n*   **Documentation:** Proof of legal origin is crucial for buying, selling, or even owning ivory. This typically includes permits, certificates of origin, and documented provenance.\n*   **Penalties:** Violating ivory laws can result in severe penalties, including hefty fines, imprisonment, and the forfeiture of the ivory.\n*   **Mammoth Ivory:** The legal status of mammoth ivory is often different from that of elephant ivory. In many jurisdictions, mammoth ivory is legal to trade because mammoths are extinct, and their ivory is considered a fossil resource. However, some regulations may still apply.\n\nIt is *essential* to thoroughly research and understand the applicable laws in your jurisdiction before buying, selling, or even possessing ivory. Ignorance of the law is not a valid defense. Consulting with a legal professional specializing in wildlife law is highly recommended.\n\n**6. Where can I find reputable appraisers or experts who can authenticate ivory items?**\n\n**Answer:** Finding a qualified appraiser or expert for ivory authentication is crucial for determining its authenticity, age, and value, as well as ensuring compliance with legal regulations. Here are some resources:\n\n*   **Professional Appraisal Organizations:** Look for appraisers certified by reputable organizations such as the Appraisers Association of America (AAA), the American Society of Appraisers (ASA), or the International Society of Appraisers (ISA). These organizations require members to meet certain standards of education, experience, and ethical conduct.\n*   **Antique Dealers and Auction Houses:** Reputable antique dealers and auction houses often have in-house experts or can recommend qualified appraisers specializing in ivory. Look for dealers with a proven track record and a strong reputation in the field.\n*   **Museums and Universities:** Contact museums with collections of ivory artifacts or universities with departments of archaeology or anthropology. Their curators or researchers may be able to provide expert opinions or refer you to qualified appraisers.\n*   **Online Directories:** Several online directories list appraisers by specialty and location. However, exercise caution and verify the credentials and experience of any appraiser you find online.\n*   **Specialty Organizations:** Organizations dedicated to the study and preservation of specific types of ivory artifacts, such as netsuke or okimono societies, may have lists of recognized experts.\n\nWhen choosing an appraiser, inquire about their experience with ivory, their credentials, and their fees. Ask for references and check their reputation before entrusting them with your valuable items. Remember that a qualified appraiser should be able to provide a written appraisal that meets accepted industry standards.\n\n**7. What are some common mistakes people make when trying to identify ivory?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying ivory can be tricky, and several common mistakes can lead to misidentification:\n\n*   **Relying Solely on Color:** As mentioned earlier, color is not a reliable indicator. Ivory yellows with age, but staining and artificial aging techniques can mimic this effect.\n*   **Ignoring Schreger Lines:** The Schreger lines, when visible, are one of the most reliable indicators. Failing to examine them carefully or misinterpreting their angles can lead to errors.\n*   **Confusing Bone for Ivory:** Bone and ivory can look similar, but bone has a more porous structure and lacks the characteristic \"engine turning\" grain pattern.\n*   **Assuming All Old White Objects are Ivory:** Many materials, including plastics, bone, and vegetable ivory, have been used to create objects that resemble ivory. Age alone does not guarantee authenticity.\n*   **Damaging the Object:** Using destructive testing methods without proper knowledge or care can damage the object and render it worthless.\n*   **Failing to Seek Professional Advice:** Attempting to identify ivory without sufficient knowledge and experience can lead to costly mistakes. Consulting with a qualified appraiser or expert is always recommended, especially for valuable items.\n*   **Ignoring Legal Restrictions:** Buying or selling ivory without understanding the applicable laws can result in legal penalties.\n*   **Focusing on One Feature:** Making a determination based on a single characteristic (like feel or sound) without considering all aspects is risky. A comprehensive approach is necessary.\n\nBy being aware of these common mistakes, you can increase your chances of accurately identifying ivory and avoid potentially costly errors.\n",
