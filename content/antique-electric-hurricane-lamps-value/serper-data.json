      "question": "How do you identify an antique electric lamp?",
      "snippet": "Check For Makers' Marks As with many types of antiques, vintage lamps are likely to have a date stamp or maker's mark somewhere.

      "question": "How old is my vintage lamp?",
      "snippet": "Unlike antique lamps that are at least a century old, a lamp is considered vintage if it's at least 20 but not more than 100 years old. Antique lamps are incredibly rare because most were invented between the 17th and 20th centuries and their production stopped right after.",
