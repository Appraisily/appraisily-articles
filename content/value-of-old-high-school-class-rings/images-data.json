    "prompt": "Macro photorealistic shot focusing on a jeweler's hands using a loupe to meticulously examine a detailed vintage 1970s gold high school class ring with a central colored gemstone. The ring is the sharp focal point, positioned slightly right of center. Softly blurred in the background on the left are appraisal tools like tweezers and a small digital scale. Lighting is bright, focused task lighting creating soft shadows, enhancing the ring's details and the professional setting. Shallow depth of field. Professional photography style. --ar 16:9",

Beside the scale, to the right, lies a small, contrasting pile of raw gold nuggets or shavings. In the soft-focus upper right background, a corner of a faded black and white high school graduation photo adds a layer of sentiment.
