Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive query about identification rare military buttons. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to ensure I cover everything thoroughly.

First, understanding what identification rare military buttons are. From the search results, it seems they're buttons from military uniforms that have historical significance, unique designs, or rarity. Their importance comes from historical value, collectibility, and sometimes monetary worth. The sources mention that Civil War-era buttons are highly sought after, and specific designs like those from the Revolutionary War can be quite valuable.

Next, the historical background. The search results reference buttons from the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Civil War, and beyond. For example, the Royal Savage shipwreck buttons (source 7) show how buttons can provide historical insights. The standardization of British buttons post-1768 (source 7) and changes in U.S. military designs over time (source 1) are key points. I should outline the evolution from regimental-specific designs to standardized military patterns.

Types and variations would include different military branches (Army, Navy, Marines), materials (brass, pewter), and eras. Source 1 mentions eagle, anchor, and state seal designs for military buttons, while fashion buttons have floral or scroll motifs. The user also needs categories like officer vs. enlisted, different regiments, and specific conflicts (e.g., Civil War infantry buttons with "I" insignia).

Determining value involves factors like age, rarity, condition, historical significance, and backmarks. Source 12 shows auction prices, and source 13 mentions a Civil War Navy button appraisal. Authenticity checks include examining construction (one-piece vs. two-piece), backmarks, and design details. For example, source 1 explains how shank attachment methods indicate age, and source 3's video discusses mold lines on pewter buttons.

Market trends: Modern buttons have less value unless from significant conflicts. Source 12 lists auction results, showing higher prices for Civil War and Revolutionary War buttons. The YouTube example (source 13) where a button sold for $200 versus potential thousands indicates market variability.

Where to buy/sell: Auctions (source 12), specialized dealers (source 15), online platforms. Preservation tips from sources 5, 9, and 13 include using wax instead of lacquer, avoiding harsh chemicals, and proper storage. For example, source 13's forum advises against lacquering and recommends Renaissance wax.

I need to structure each section with headers, include examples like specific regiments or battles, and cite sources appropriately. Make sure to mention case studies like the Royal Savage buttons (source 7) and the Civil War examples from sources 2 and 8. Also, highlight the difference between military and fashion buttons (source 1 and 6) to help identification.

Check that all eight user points are addressed, use specific data points (e.g., auction prices, specific historical events), and ensure the information flows logically. Avoid any markdown formatting as per instructions, but in the final answer, apply the required headers and citations. Make sure each section is comprehensive but concise, using bullet points or tables where appropriate for readability.

## Identification and Value of Rare Military Buttons  

### 1. Definition and Significance  
**Identification rare military buttons** are historically significant uniform fasteners used by armed forces, distinguished by unique designs, materials, or regimental markings. Their value stems from:  
- **Historical importance**: Links to specific conflicts (e.g., Revolutionary War, Civil War)[7][12].  
- **Rarity**: Limited production runs or survival rates (e.g., War of 1812 regimental buttons)[3][8].  
- **Collectibility**: High demand among historians and militaria enthusiasts[4][12].  
For example, Continental Army buttons from the Revolutionary War can fetch thousands of dollars due to their scarcity[3][7].  

---

### 2. Historical Development  
Military buttons evolved from functional fasteners to symbols of rank and unit identity:  
- **18th century**: British regiments used colonel-specific designs until standardized by King George III in 1768[7].  
- **Civil War era**: U.S. buttons featured branch-specific motifs (e.g., "I" for Infantry, "C" for Cavalry)[1][8].  
- **20th century**: Standardized designs emerged (e.g., U.S. Army’s Great Seal button post-1902)[1].  
The 1941 U.S. Navy button redesign (eagle facing right) exemplifies incremental changes tied to historical events[1].

### 3. Types and Variations  
Key categories include:  
| **Type**               | **Characteristics**                                                                 | **Examples**                                  |  
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|  
| **Branch-specific**     | Eagle (Army), anchor (Navy), crossed cannons (Artillery)                            | Civil War "I" Infantry buttons[1][8]          |  
| **Regimental**          | Unit numbers or symbols (e.g., 23rd Regiment of Foot)[7]                            | Revolutionary War Massachusetts Grand Army[7] |  
| **Material-based**      | Brass (officers), pewter (enlisted), modern alloys[6][15]                           | 18th-century pewter Continental Army buttons[3] |  
| **Conflict-era**        | Designs tied to wars (e.g., War of 1812 "frog-legged eagle")[2][8]                  | Royal Savage shipwreck buttons (1776)[7]      |

### 4. Valuation Factors  
- **Age**: Pre-1900 buttons (e.g., Revolutionary War) command higher prices[3][12].  
- **Condition**: Unblemished surfaces and intact shanks increase value (e.g., non-dug pewter buttons)[3][13].  
- **Provenance**: Documented links to battles or figures (e.g., Arthur Lowe’s WWII uniform button)[12].  
- **Backmarks**: Manufacturer stamps (e.g., Scovill, Waterbury) aid authentication[1][6].  
A Civil War Navy button in pristine condition sold for $1,300, while damaged examples may fetch under $200[13].  

---

### 5. Authenticity Identification  
- **Construction**: One-piece brazed shanks (18th century) vs. crimped two-piece (post-1813)[1].  
- **Design accuracy**: Compare to known references (e.g., Tice’s *Uniform Buttons of the United States*)[1].  
- **Patina**: Natural oxidation patterns; repros often lack depth[3][9].  
- **Backmarks**: Match historical manufacturer timelines (e.g., Scovill post-1850)[1][6].  

---

### 6. Market Trends  
- **High-value segments**: Revolutionary/Civil War buttons dominate auctions (e.g., $15,000 for a *Saving Private Ryan* costume button)[12].  
- **Modern buttons**: Post-Korean War examples have minimal collector interest[1][15].  
- **Reproductions**: Mass-produced "military-style" fashion buttons (e.g., anchor motifs) flood markets but lack historical value[6][15].  

---

### 7. Acquisition and Sales Channels  
- **Auctions**: Specialized platforms like The Saleroom realize prices up to $30,000 for screen-used military costumes[12].  
- **Dealers**: Reputable sellers (e.g., Fugawee, Military Heritage) offer authenticated specimens[8][15].  
- **Shows/Online**: Militaria conventions and eBay cater to niche buyers[4][12].  

---

### 8. Preservation Guidelines  
- **Cleaning**: Use lemon juice and ammonia for brass[9]; avoid water on celluloid or unbaked ceramic[5].  
- **Storage**: Climate-controlled environments to prevent oxidation[13][15].  
- **Conservation**: Apply Renaissance wax instead of lacquer to preserve patina[5][13].  
For example, Civil War brass buttons require degreasing and waxing to maintain historical integrity[9][13].
