Jeré\" or \"Curtis Jere'\") isn't a person, but rather the trade name of Artisan House, a metal art company founded in 1964 by Curtis Freiler and Jerry Fels. They aimed to create gallery-quality art accessible to a wider audience by producing striking, often whimsical, mid-century modern sculptures and wall decor. Their work is highly collectible because it captures the aesthetic of that era, offers a unique blend of craftsmanship and artistic vision, and is relatively affordable compared to unique, one-off sculptures.\n\n*   **Key Characteristics:** Curtis Jere' pieces are typically made from welded, brazed, or otherwise joined metal pieces, often brass, copper, steel, and other materials. Common themes include birds, trees, sailboats, geometric designs, and abstract shapes.\n*   **Collectibility Factors:** The designs are visually appealing, often large-scale, and make a statement. The \"Curtis Jere'\" name is synonymous with quality mid-century metal art, driving demand. Rarity of specific designs or color combinations also contributes to value.\n*   **Production Volume:** While Artisan House produced a large volume of pieces, specific designs were not always made in mass quantities, adding to the desirability of certain items. The brand continues today under new ownership, but collectors generally favor the vintage pieces produced under Freiler and Fels.\n\n**2. Where can I find the signature or markings on a Curtis Jere piece?**\n\n**Answer:** Locating the signature is crucial for identifying a genuine Curtis Jere' piece, but it can sometimes be challenging. The signature is most commonly found in one of the following places:\n\n*   **Metal Tags:** These are small, often rectangular or oval metal tags that are attached to the sculpture, usually with a rivet or small screw. The tag will typically read \"Curtis Jere'\" or \"C. Jeré\". Check the back, base, or underside of the piece carefully.\n*   **Etched or Stamped Signature:** Some pieces have the \"Curtis Jere'\" name etched or stamped directly into the metal. This can be found on a base, a leaf, or another component of the sculpture. Look closely, as the etching can be subtle and easily overlooked.\n*   **Paper Labels:** Less common, but occasionally found, are paper labels. These are more fragile and often missing due to age. If present, they'll likely be on the back or underside of the piece.\n*   **Hidden Locations:** For larger wall sculptures, the signature might be placed on a less visible area, such as the back of a panel or the inside of a component.\n\n**Important Note:** Be wary of pieces without any markings. While some very early or prototype pieces may lack a signature, the vast majority will have some form of identification. Also, be cautious of signatures that appear inconsistent or sloppy, as these could indicate a forgery.\n\n**3. How can I tell if a Curtis Jere piece is authentic or a reproduction?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining authenticity requires careful examination and knowledge of Curtis Jere' pieces. Here are some key indicators:\n\n*   **Signature Consistency:** Compare the signature on your piece to known authentic examples online. Pay attention to the font, size, and style of the lettering. Inconsistencies are a red flag.\n*   **Construction Quality:** Authentic Curtis Jere' pieces are well-made, with clean welds and attention to detail. Look for sloppy craftsmanship, uneven finishes, or poor-quality materials, which can indicate a reproduction.\n*   **Materials Used:** Original pieces typically used brass, copper, steel, and sometimes other metals. Examine the metal closely. Modern reproductions might use cheaper alloys or finishes that don't match the originals.\n*   **Design and Style:** Research the design of your piece. Curtis Jere' produced a wide range of designs, but some are more common than others. If the design seems unusual or unlike anything you've seen before, it could be a reproduction or a less common piece.\n*   **Age and Patina:** Authentic vintage pieces will have a natural patina and signs of age. While some collectors polish their pieces, the presence of some age-related wear is a good sign. A piece that looks brand new, even if it's claimed to be vintage, should be scrutinized carefully.\n*   **Weight:** Often, reproductions will be lighter than the originals due to the use of thinner or different materials.\n\n**4. What are some of the most popular and valuable Curtis Jere designs?**\n\n**Answer:** Several Curtis Jere' designs are particularly sought after by collectors, commanding higher prices:\n\n*   **\"Raindrops\" or \"Sputnik\" Sculptures:** These starburst-shaped sculptures are iconic and highly desirable. They often feature brass rods with colored glass or acrylic accents.\n*   **\"Cityscape\" Sculptures:** These depict stylized city skylines and are often large and impressive.\n*   **\"Birds in Flight\" Sculptures:** Depictions of birds, especially those with graceful, elongated wings, are consistently popular.\n*   **\"Trees\" Sculptures:** Trees with intricate branches and leaves, often made of brass or copper, are also in demand.\n*   **Large-Scale Wall Sculptures:** Pieces that are particularly large or complex, regardless of the specific design, tend to be more valuable due to their rarity and visual impact.\n\n**Factors Affecting Value:** Condition, size, design, and rarity all play a role in determining the value of a Curtis Jere' piece. Pieces in excellent condition with original finishes and rare designs will command the highest prices. Provenance, or the history of ownership, can also add value.\n\n**5.

The better the condition, the higher the value.\n3.  **Research Comparable Sales:** Search online auction sites like eBay (completed listings), liveauctioneers.com, and invaluable.com for similar pieces that have recently sold. Pay close attention to the final sale price, not just the asking price.\n4.  **Consider Location:** Location can influence value. Pieces sold in major metropolitan areas or at specialized auctions often fetch higher prices.\n5.  **Consult with an Appraiser:** For high-value or rare pieces, consider consulting with a professional appraiser specializing in mid-century modern art or decorative arts.
