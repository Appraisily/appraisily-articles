Okay, I need to tackle this query about old milk bottle identification. Let me start by breaking down the user's requirements. They want a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects. First, I should understand each part of the query to ensure I address everything thoroughly.

The user is asking for a detailed guide, so structure is key. They mentioned sections with headings, examples, case studies, and data. I need to make sure each of the eight points is a section, and within those, maybe subsections for better organization.

Looking at the search results provided, there's a lot of information on dating milk bottles, identifying features like shape, labels, and embossing, spotting reproductions, and market trends. Sources like LoveToKnow, Dr. Lori's site, and the PDFs from historical associations will be useful. I should cross-reference these to ensure accuracy.

For the first section, defining old milk bottle identification and its importance, I can pull from the historical significance mentioned in sources [1] and [2], which talk about how milk bottles were used before modern packaging and how their features help in dating. The importance lies in historical preservation and collectible value, so I'll highlight that.

The historical background would cover the transition from metal containers to glass bottles, the role of dairies, and technological advancements in glass manufacturing. Sources [2], [7], and [8] mention the Thatcher Manufacturing Company and Owens-Illinois, which are key players here. Including dates like the 1870s for mold seams and 1933 for applied color labels from [1] and [2] will add depth.

Types and variations would involve discussing shapes (round vs. square), labels (etched, embossed, color), and materials. Source [1] details shape differences, while [2] and [19] talk about labels and colored glass. Mentioning rare examples like Borden's red bottles from [19] can serve as a case study.

Determining value factors: Rarity, condition, historical significance. Sources [1], [2], and [19] note that war slogans, Disney images, and specific dairies increase value. The PDFs [3] and [4] discuss mold seams and pontil marks, which affect authenticity and thus value.

Identifying authenticity involves checking mold seams, labels, and base marks. Sources [1], [2], and [4] provide methods like checking if color labels scratch off (fake) or looking for Owens scars. The Cockayne Farmstead example in [8] shows how manufacturer marks and dates help authenticate.

Market trends: The market reports in [9], [10], and [12] indicate growth in the milk bottle market, with a CAGR around 5%. Current pricing examples from [13] and eBay listings in [1] can illustrate this. Also, the shift towards sustainable packaging might influence modern reproductions' popularity.

Where to buy/sell: Online platforms like eBay, Ruby Lane, and specialized sites like Milkbottlesforsale.com from [1]. Physical locations like antique stores and flea markets are also mentioned. Caution about reproductions on eBay is important here.

Care and maintenance: Tips from [17] and [18] on cleaning with mild soap, avoiding harsh chemicals, and proper storage. The Instructables guide on restoring milk cans [18] can be adapted for bottles, emphasizing gentle handling to preserve labels.

I need to ensure each section flows logically, with citations from the provided sources. For example, when discussing mold seams, cite [4] and [6], which talk about Owens machine marks and mold numbers. When mentioning reproductions, use examples from [1] and [19] about Disney and Wheaton Glass Works.

Also, check for any conflicting information. For instance, source [19] mentions colored bottles were rare because consumers preferred clear glass, which aligns with [3] discussing milk glass. Make sure to present consistent info.

Including specific examples like the 1932 bottle from Cockayne Farmstead [8] adds concrete details. Market data from [9] and [10] should be presented with exact figures and projections to support trends.

Finally, structure each section with headers, avoid lists, and use paragraphs to maintain flow. Ensure citations are correctly formatted with brackets. Now, putting all this together into a coherent, well-structured article covering all eight points with depth and accuracy.

## 1. Fundamentals of Old Milk Bottle Identification  

### Definition and Historical Context  
Old milk bottle identification involves analyzing physical and historical attributes to determine a bottle’s age, origin, and authenticity. Before paper cartons (patented 1915) and plastic jugs (1960s), dairies used returnable glass bottles, creating a standardized yet regionally diverse packaging system. The first patented milk bottle, Harvey D. Thatcher’s “Common Sense” design (1884[7]), featured a sealed lid to prevent contamination—a revolutionary step in food safety.  

### Importance and Value Drivers  
- **Cultural Preservation**: Bottles document local dairy histories, such as the Cockayne Farmstead’s 1932 Clarion, Pennsylvania-made specimen linked to New Jersey’s Glendale Farms[8].  
- **Technological Record**: Mold seams reveal shifts from hand-blown (pre-1870s[4]) to machine-made production (Owens Automatic Bottle Machine, 1905–1920[2][4]).  
- **Economic Indicators**: Applied color labels (post-1933[1]) correlate with dairy industry marketing budgets during the Great Depression.  

---

## 2. Historical Evolution of Milk Bottle Production  

### Early Innovations (1870–1910)  
- **Three-Piece Molds**: Produced bottles with vertical seams from base to neck, visible in pre-1910 specimens[2][6].  
- **Embossed Logos**: Dairies like Thatcher Mfg. Co. used raised glass lettering to deter reuse by competitors[7][19].  
- **Material Shifts**: Transition from milk glass (opaque white, bone ash-infused[3]) to clear glass for consumer transparency[19].  

### Industrialization Era (1910–1950)  
- **Automation**: Owens-Illinois’ suction scar (rough, off-center base mark[2][4]) dominated 1905–1920.  
- **War-Era Slogans**: WWII bottles featured patriotic messages like “Buy War Bonds,” now highly collectible[1][19].  
- **Standardization**: Square bottles (1940s[1]) optimized crate space during wartime metal shortages.
