Okay, I need to tackle this query about antique rocking chair value. The user wants a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects. Let me start by breaking down each part of the query to make sure I address everything.

First, I'll look at the search results provided. There are 13 sources, ranging from marketplaces like Chairish and Pamono to guides on identification, restoration, and market trends. Source [3] and [8] seem particularly relevant for factors affecting value and identification. Source [2] gives historical context, which is needed for section 2. Sources [5] and [6] might help with market trends and where to buy. Restoration tips from sources [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], and [13] will be useful for the maintenance section.

For section 1, defining antique rocking chair value, I should explain what makes them valuable—historical significance, craftsmanship, rarity. Source [3] mentions factors like rarity and manufacturer marks. Source [8] also talks about value ranges based on style and condition.

Historical background in section 2: Source [2] credits Benjamin Franklin with the invention in 1710, mentions Shakers perfecting the design. The Boston rocker from 1840 and Bentwood from 1860 are key points. I'll need to summarize this evolution.

Types and categories (section 3): Windsor, Boston, Bentwood, wicker, and mission styles are mentioned in sources [2], [3], [6], [8]. Each has distinct features and value ranges. For example, Windsor rockers with spindle backs, Bentwood by Thonet.

Factors determining value (section 4): Condition, rarity, provenance, materials. Source [3] has tables showing how condition affects value. Rarity from unique designs or known makers. Source [8] adds that wicker chairs with specific patterns can be more valuable.

Identifying authenticity (section 5): Look for hand-crafted details, wear patterns, original parts. Source [4] advises checking for machine-made vs. hand-made nails. Source [8] suggests examining materials and finishes for age clues.

Market trends (section 6): Source [5] mentions the rocker chair market growing to $3.45B by 2033. High demand for iconic models like Thonet and Stickley. Online sales via Chairish and Pamono are key platforms.

Buying/selling (section 7): Chairish, Pamono, auctions, antique dealers. Source [1] and [6] list these marketplaces. Professional appraisals are recommended in source [8].

Maintenance (section 8): Cleaning with gentle solutions (source [7]), avoiding harsh chemicals, using protectors (source [12]), professional restoration for structural issues (sources [10], [11], [13]).

I need to organize all this into sections with headers, cite sources appropriately, and include examples like specific models and price ranges. Make sure each section flows logically and covers all the user's points. Also, check that citations are correctly placed after relevant sentences, using the right source numbers. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer should follow the format rules with headers, lists, and citations.

Antique rocking chairs hold both historical and monetary value, influenced by craftsmanship, provenance, and market demand. Their worth stems from their role as cultural artifacts, with prices ranging from $100 to over $3,500 depending on style, condition, and rarity. Below is a detailed analysis of their value drivers, market trends, and preservation practices.

## 1. Defining Antique Rocking Chair Value  
Antique rocking chair value reflects their historical significance, craftsmanship, and rarity. These chairs are prized for:  
- **Cultural heritage**: Many models, like Shaker or Windsor designs, represent early American furniture-making traditions[2][8].  
- **Artisan craftsmanship**: Hand-carved details, joinery techniques (e.g., dovetailing), and materials like solid oak or bentwood increase value[3][11].  
- **Functional artistry**: Their dual role as decorative and practical furniture sustains demand among collectors and interior designers[5][6].  

---

## 2. Historical Evolution  
- **1710**: Benjamin Franklin is credited with inventing the rocking chair in America, though English Windsor designs with "birdcage" spindles emerged earlier[2].  
- **1840**: The Boston rocker became the first mass-produced model, featuring a scroll-shaped seat and stenciled motifs[2][8].  
- **1860s**: Michael Thonet’s bentwood rockers revolutionized production with steam-bent beechwood, while Stickley’s Mission-style designs emphasized simplicity[2][6].

| Style                | Features                                  | Average Value Range |  
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|

## 4. Value Determinants  
- **Condition**:  
  - *Excellent* (no repairs): $1,200–$1,600[3]  
  - *Poor* (major repairs): Under $400[3]  
- **Rarity**: Chairs with unique attributes (e.g., steer horn arms) or limited production (e.g., pre-1900 Shaker models) command premiums[3][4].  
- **Provenance**: Markings from makers like Hitchcock or Thonet boost value by 30–50%[8][10].  
- **Materials**: Solid hardwoods (oak, walnut) outvalue pine or synthetic wicker[3][8].  

---

## 5. Authenticity Identification  
- **Construction clues**:  
  - Hand-forged nails (pre-1900) vs. machine-cut nails[4][8].  
  - Symmetrical wear on runners and armrests[4][12].  
- **Finish tests**: Shellac-based coatings dissolve with denatured alcohol, while modern polyurethane remains intact[9].  
- **Documentation**: Look for labels, stamps, or auction records linking chairs to workshops like Stickley or Heywood-Wakefield[6][8].  

---

## 6. Market Trends (2024–2033)  
- The global rocker chair market is projected to grow at 5.1% CAGR, reaching $3.45B by 2033[5].  
- **High-demand models**:  
  - Thonet No. 14 bentwood rockers: $2,000–$4,000[6].  
  - Stickley Mission rockers: $3,000+ at auction[3].  
- Online platforms like Chairish and Pamono dominate sales, offering curated 19th-century pieces[1][6].

- **Specialist retailers**: Chairish lists 100+ antique rockers, including a $629 Victorian walnut model[1].  
- **Appraisals**: Experts charge $75–$150/hour to authenticate and value chairs[8].  

---

## 8. Preservation Guidelines  
- **Cleaning**: Use 1 Tbsp turpentine + linseed oil in warm water for grime removal[7].  
- **Structural care**:  
  - Apply tung oil annually to prevent wood drying[9][12].  
  - Replace worn runners with oak or teak to maintain balance[12][13].  
- **Storage**: Avoid direct sunlight and humidity above 60% to prevent warping[12][13].
