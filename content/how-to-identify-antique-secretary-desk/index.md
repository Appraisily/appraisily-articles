Okay, I need to help the user with their query on how to identify an antique secretary desk. Let me start by understanding what exactly they're asking for. They want a comprehensive article covering several aspects, from definitions to market trends. 

First, I'll check the search results provided. The user has given 16 sources, so I need to go through them to find relevant information. Let me start by skimming each source to see which ones discuss identification, history, types, valuation factors, authenticity, market trends, buying/selling, and maintenance.

Looking at source [1], it talks about valuing antique desks in general, including factors like age, craftsmanship, and provenance. This could be useful for sections on value determination and authenticity. Source [2] gives historical background on secretary desks evolving from escritoires in 18th century France. That's good for the historical section. Source [3] lists different types like pedestal, partners, and secretaire desks, which will help categorize the types. 

Source [4] mentions features like hand carvings and secret compartments, which are important for identifying authenticity. Source [7] provides tips on identifying antique desks, such as looking for maker's marks and construction techniques. This is crucial for the identification section. Source [8] gives more historical context, mentioning Jean-Francois Oeben as the creator of the first secretaire desk. 

Sources [9], [13], [14], [15], and [16] have examples of secretary desks with prices and descriptions, useful for market trends and where to buy. Sources [6] and [4] discuss maintenance tips like cleaning and avoiding sunlight, which fits into the care section. 

Now, structuring the answer according to the user's requested sections. For each section, I need to pull relevant info from the sources and cite them properly. Let's start with defining what an antique secretary desk is. From sources [2], [7], and [8], I can explain it's a desk with a drop-leaf surface and storage, originating from 18th-century France. Importance comes from historical value and craftsmanship, as per [1] and [5].

Historical background should include the evolution from escritoires, key periods like Georgian, Victorian, and notable makers like Chippendale and Oeben, using sources [2], [8], and [7]. 

Types and variations: Source [3] lists pedestal, partners, secretaire, roll-top, etc. Source [7] adds slant-front and mechanical types. I'll categorize these with brief descriptions.

Factors affecting value: Source [1] mentions age, wood type, craftsmanship, provenance. Source [12] adds maker's reputation. Need to elaborate on each, maybe include examples from [9] where specific woods and makers are noted.

Identifying authenticity: Check for maker's marks (source [7]), construction techniques like dovetails (source [1]), signs of aging versus reproductions (source [12]). Also, original hardware and patina (source [6]).

Market trends: Source [5] discusses the decline in "brown furniture" but niche demand. Auction results from [5] and [9] show price ranges. Current platforms like Bidsquare, LiveAuctioneers (sources [10], [14]) are where to buy.

Buying/selling: Mention auction houses, online platforms, dealers. Source [12] suggests getting appraisals from Mearto. 

Care and maintenance: Use tips from [4] and [6] on cleaning, avoiding sunlight, using coasters, and professional restoration.

I need to ensure each section is comprehensive, cites the relevant sources, and includes examples. For instance, when discussing types, mention the Georgian pedestal desk from [3] or the French Directoire roll-top in [9]. When talking about value, reference the Thomas Moses desk's price drop from [5]. 

Also, check that all eight user-requested sections are covered. Make sure the answer is structured with headers, uses markdown appropriately, and citations are correctly placed. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer should follow the format rules given. Need to be thorough but concise, using bullet points or tables where suitable. Let me organize all this information into the structured sections now.
