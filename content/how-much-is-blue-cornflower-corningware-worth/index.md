Okay, I need to tackle this query about the value of Blue Cornflower CorningWare. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects, from historical background to current market trends and care tips. 

First, I'll check the search results provided. There are 16 sources, including articles, YouTube videos, and product pages. Let me go through each one to gather relevant information.

From source [1], I see that Blue Cornflower was introduced in 1958, made of Pyroceram, and production stopped in 2000. Prices vary widely, from $0.50 to $10 for common pieces, up to thousands for rare items. The backstamp changes over time (two words vs. one) can help date the pieces. Also, mentions of where to find them: estate sales, online auctions, etc.

Source [2] mentions that while Cornflower is common, other patterns like Spice of Life and Floral Bouquet can fetch higher prices. However, Blue Cornflower's value is lower due to its abundance. Some sets are listed for up to $30,000, but that might be inflated.

Source [3] discusses specific high sales, like a dish sold for $12,000, but notes that most listings are $5-$40. It emphasizes rarity and condition as key factors. The Cornflower pattern is common but still valuable.

Source [4] gives historical context about Pyroceram, developed by Corning, and its use in missiles. The reissue in 2017 for the 60th anniversary is mentioned. Tips on identifying authentic pieces via backstamps and avoiding stoneware post-2000.

Source [5] is a product page showing current prices for Cornflower pieces on Replacements.com, ranging from $15.99 to $119.95. This gives a snapshot of current market prices for individual pieces.

Source [6] is a YouTube video debunking high valuations, suggesting that most pieces aren't worth thousands and that high listings might be scams. Important to note this skepticism.

Source [7] is another YouTube video about cleaning a loaf pan, which might be useful for the care section.

Source [8] from lovetoknow.com lists average values: Cornflower Blue $15-$45 per piece. Other patterns have different values. Also mentions factors like condition, rarity, and completeness of sets.

Source [9] is about the cornflower plant, which might not be relevant unless discussing the design inspiration.

Source [10] has cleaning tips using mild soap and bleach, which could be adapted for care instructions.

Source [11] mentions the 60th-anniversary reissue in 2017, indicating that newer pieces exist but vintage is more valuable.

Source [12] is a YouTube video discussing rare patterns and overpriced items, reinforcing that Blue Cornflower is common but some 80s patterns are sought after.

Source [13] from an antiques appraiser notes that Blue Cornflower is the most common but still collectible, with prices $50-$500. Mentions other patterns like Starburst and Floral Bouquet.

Source [14] is a forum post predicting 2025 trends, listing Blue Cornflower as top, but since it's a 2025 prediction, maybe not as reliable but shows ongoing interest.

Source [15] repeats info from source [3], so likely same data.

Source [16] from rarest.org mentions specific high-value items, like a 5-QT range-topper selling for $300+, but also notes that original sloped-side dishes are older and more valuable.

Now, structuring the answer according to the user's eight points:

1. **What and Why Important**: Blue Cornflower CorningWare is vintage cookware known for durability and design. Its value comes from nostalgia, material (Pyroceram), and versatility. Important as a collectible and functional item.

2. **Historical Background**: Developed in 1958, Pyroceram material from WWII tech. Discontinued in 2000, reissued in 2017. Used in both kitchens and aerospace.

3. **Types/Variations**: Different eras (pre-1998 vs. post), sizes (1qt to 5qt), and reissues. Also, original vs. copycats.

4. **Value Factors**: Rarity (production years), condition, completeness (lids, sets), backstamp details, provenance.

5. **Authenticity**: Check backstamp (two words vs. one), material (Pyroceram vs. stoneware), pattern details (three flowers, white background), expert appraisal.

6. **Market Trends**: Common pieces $15-$45, rare or complete sets up to $1,600+. High listings (like $4,999) may be inflated. Demand driven by retro trends.

7. **Where to Buy/Sell**: Estate sales, eBay, Etsy, Replacements.com, antique shops. Beware of overpriced items; verify authenticity.

8. **Care Tips**: Clean with mild soap, avoid abrasives. For stains, use baking soda or vinegar. Check for chips/cracks. Proper storage to prevent damage.

I need to ensure each section is detailed, cites sources appropriately, and includes examples. For instance, in market trends, mention the $12,000 sale but also the average prices from Replacements and lovetoknow. Highlight the discrepancy between some high listings and typical sales.

Also, address the skepticism from source [6] about inflated prices. Maybe in the market trends section, note that while some listings are high, actual sales are lower, and condition is key.

In care tips, use the cleaning methods from source [10] and [7], like using mild soap and avoiding bleach unless necessary.

Make sure to structure with headers, avoid lists, use paragraphs, and cite sources like [1], [2], [8], etc., after relevant sentences.

# The Value and Legacy of Vintage Blue Cornflower CorningWare  

Vintage Blue Cornflower CorningWare represents a significant chapter in American kitchenware history, blending functionality with mid-century design. First introduced in 1958, these pieces are celebrated for their durability, versatility, and iconic blue floral motif. While common in households for decades, their value today stems from nostalgia, material innovation, and collectibility. This guide explores the historical context, valuation factors, market trends, and preservation practices for these enduring pieces.

## Historical Background and Development  

CorningWare’s Blue Cornflower line emerged from post-war technological advancements. The cookware was crafted from **Pyroceram**, a glass-ceramic composite initially developed by Corning Glass Works for military applications, including missile nose cones and spacecraft components[4][11]. This material’s thermal resilience—capable of withstanding temperatures from -40°F to 900°F—made it ideal for oven-to-table use, revolutionizing home cooking[1][4].  

The Blue Cornflower pattern, featuring three stylized blooms on a white background, debuted in 1958 as part of CorningWare’s inaugural collection. Designed by Joseph Baum of the Charles Brunelle Advertising Agency, the pattern drew inspiration from traditional blue-and-white porcelain but catered to modern convenience[13]. Production of Pyroceram-based CorningWare ceased in 2000, replaced by stoneware, though a limited reissue in 2017 commemorated the line’s 60th anniversary[1][11].

## Types and Variations  

### Era-Based Distinctions  
- **Pre-1998 Pieces**: Marked with “Corning Ware” (two words) on the backstamp. Early designs (1958–1972) featured sloped sides and smaller handles[1][8].  
- **Post-1998 Pieces**: Labeled “Corningware” (one word). Post-2000 stoneware lacks Pyroceram’s durability and is less collectible[1][4].  
- **Reissues (2017–Present)**: Modern reproductions mimic the classic pattern but lack the historical significance of vintage pieces[11].  

### Product Range  
The original lineup included casserole dishes (1–5 quarts), saucepans, teapots, and percolators. Rare items like **range-toppers** (stovetop-compatible pots) and **Gemco creamers** command premium prices due to limited production[16][5].  

---

## Factors Influencing Value  

1. **Rarity**: Short-run patterns like **Floral Bouquet (1971–1975)** or **Wildflower (1977–1984)** fetch higher prices than the ubiquitous Blue Cornflower[2][8].  
2. **Condition**: Chips, cracks, or discoloration reduce value. A 1.5-quart casserole in mint condition with its Pyrex lid may sell for $120, while damaged pieces often trade below $20[5][8].  
3. **Completeness**: Sets with original lids and packaging (e.g., a sealed 4-casserole set listed for $4,999) are prized[1][15].  
4. **Provenance**: Pieces from early production years or with unique markings (e.g., “P-4-B” model codes) attract collectors[5][13].  

---

## Authenticity Identification  

1. **Backstamp Analysis**:  
   - Pre-1998 stamps read “Corning Ware”; post-1998 use “Corningware”[1].  
   - Absence of a stamp suggests a counterfeit[4].  
2. **Material Verification**: Pyroceram is lightweight, non-porous, and resistant to thermal shock. Stoneware (post-2000) is heavier and less durable[4][11].  
3. **Pattern Consistency**: Authentic Blue Cornflower features three symmetrical blooms with slender leaves. Copycats often distort the design or use brighter blues[1][13].

## Current Market Trends  

While viral listings tout prices up to $10,000, most transactions reflect more modest valuations:  
- **Common Pieces**: Individual casseroles average $15–$45[8][15].  
- **Complete Sets**: A 21-piece collection sold for $70, while rare 5-quart range-toppers reach $300–$1,600[5][16].  
- **Inflated Listings**: High asking prices (e.g., $30,000 for a Spice of Life set) often fail to sell, reflecting speculative trends rather than realized value[2][6].  

The 2020s have seen renewed interest in mid-century aesthetics, driving demand at estate sales and online platforms like Etsy and eBay[1][14].

## Acquisition and Resale Channels  

1. **Estate Sales and Thrift Stores**: Prime sources for undervalued pieces, often priced under $10[1][4].  
2. **Online Marketplaces**:  
   - **eBay**: Listings range from $5 (single dishes) to $4,999 (rare sets)[3][15].  
   - **Replacements Ltd.**: Sells vintage pieces like 1.5-quart casseroles for $119.95[5].  
3. **Antique Shops**: Curated selections offer authenticated items but at higher markups[4][13].  

---

## Care and Preservation  

1. **Cleaning**:  
   - Use mild dish soap and warm water. For stubborn stains, apply a paste of baking soda and water[7][10].  
   - Avoid abrasive scrubbers to prevent scratching[10].  
2. **Storage**: Stack with protective cloth between pieces to minimize chips.  
3. **Usage Tips**:  
   - Avoid sudden temperature changes (e.g., transferring from freezer to oven) to preserve Pyroceram integrity[4].  
   - Discard pieces with cracks, as they compromise thermal resistance[1].  

---

## Conclusion  

Vintage Blue Cornflower CorningWare embodies a unique intersection of historical innovation and domestic charm. While its value rarely reaches the thousands touted online, well-preserved pieces remain desirable for collectors and practical users alike. As retro aesthetics continue influencing modern interiors, these items serve as functional heirlooms, bridging past and present culinary traditions.  

For enthusiasts, the hunt for Blue Cornflower pieces—whether at flea markets or auctions—offers both nostalgia and the thrill of discovery, ensuring their legacy endures in kitchens and collections worldwide[1][14].
