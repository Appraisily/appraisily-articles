  "content": "**People Also Ask (how much is blue cornflower corningware worth)**\n\n**1. What is Blue Cornflower CorningWare and why is it popular?**\n\n**Answer:** Blue Cornflower CorningWare refers to a specific pattern within the CorningWare line of cookware and bakeware. Introduced in 1957, it features a simple yet iconic design of stylized blue cornflower blossoms against a white background. Its popularity stems from a combination of factors: its durability (being resistant to chipping, breaking, and temperature extremes), its versatility (oven-to-table capabilities), and its nostalgic appeal. Many people grew up with Blue Cornflower CorningWare in their homes, associating it with family meals and cherished memories. This nostalgia, coupled with the inherent practicality of the product, fuels ongoing demand in the vintage market. The pattern was widely produced for decades, making it relatively common, but certain pieces and conditions command higher prices due to rarity or collectibility. The iconic design, ease of use, and durability ensured its place in millions of homes, leading to its enduring popularity.\n\n**2. How can I identify genuine Blue Cornflower CorningWare?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying genuine Blue Cornflower CorningWare involves several key checks:\n\n*   **Pattern Accuracy:** The blue cornflower design should be crisp, well-defined, and consistent across all pieces. Faded or blurry designs may indicate a reproduction or heavy use.\n\n*   **Backstamp:** Look for the CorningWare backstamp on the underside of the dish or lid. This stamp typically includes the CorningWare logo, the pattern name (\"Cornflower\"), and the manufacturing location (e.g., Corning, NY). Variations in the backstamp exist based on the era of production. Research these variations to ensure the stamp matches the piece's supposed age.\n\n*   **Material:** CorningWare is made from Pyroceram, a unique glass-ceramic material. It should feel smooth and dense.\n\n*   **Lid Compatibility:** Ensure the lid fits snugly and correctly on the corresponding dish. Lids were often marked with their intended dish size.\n\n*   **Absence of Obvious Flaws:** While vintage items may have minor imperfections, excessive chips, cracks, or staining can significantly reduce value.\n\n*   **Beware of \"Cornflower Blue\" Variations:** Some patterns mimic the Blue Cornflower but are not genuine CorningWare. Pay close attention to the detail and style of the flower design.\n\n**3. What factors influence the value of Blue Cornflower CorningWare?**\n\n**Answer:** Several factors impact the value of Blue Cornflower CorningWare:\n\n*   **Condition:** Excellent condition, free of chips, cracks, stains, or scratches, is paramount. Pieces in mint or near-mint condition command the highest prices.\n\n*   **Rarity:** Certain pieces, such as promotional items, discontinued sizes, or variations in the pattern, are rarer than others and therefore more valuable. For instance, larger casserole dishes or those with specific lid variations are typically more sought after.\n\n*   **Size and Type:** Larger pieces generally fetch higher prices than smaller ones. Casserole dishes, particularly those with lids, are usually more valuable than ramekins.\n\n*   **Completeness:** Casserole dishes with their original lids are worth more than those without. Sets are also more valuable than individual pieces.\n\n*   **Market Demand:** Current trends and collector preferences can influence prices. High demand in specific regions or among particular collector groups can drive up values.\n\n*   **Provenance:** If you can trace the history of a piece back to its original owner or a significant event, it may increase its value.\n\n*   **Location:** Prices can vary regionally.\n\n**4. What are some of the most valuable Blue Cornflower CorningWare pieces?**\n\n**Answer:** While Blue Cornflower is generally common, certain pieces are more valuable:\n\n*   **Large Casserole Dishes with Lids (e.g., 5-quart):** These are highly sought after for their practicality and size. A mint condition 5-quart casserole with lid can fetch upwards of $75-$150.\n\n*   **Rare Lid Variations:** Certain lids with unusual designs or markings are more valuable. This includes lids with a different color or pattern than the standard lid.\n\n*   **Promotional Items:** Pieces specifically created for promotional purposes, often with unique shapes or sizes, can be highly collectible. These are harder to find and may be worth much more.\n\n*   **Complete Sets:** A complete set of Blue Cornflower CorningWare in excellent condition is more valuable than individual pieces sold separately.\n\n*   **Specific Handle Shapes:** Some variations in the handle shape or design can make a piece more desirable to collectors.\n\n*   **Items in Original Packaging:** Pieces that are still in their original boxes are in high demand.\n\nIt's important to note that prices fluctuate, so checking recent sales on sites like eBay and Etsy is crucial for accurate valuation.\n\n**5. Where can I buy or sell Blue Cornflower CorningWare?**\n\n**Answer:** Several avenues exist for buying and selling Blue Cornflower CorningWare:\n\n*   **Online Marketplaces:** eBay, Etsy, and Facebook Marketplace are popular platforms for buying and selling vintage CorningWare. Research prices and compare condition before making a purchase or setting a price.\n\n*   **Antique Stores and Flea Markets:** These venues offer the opportunity to inspect pieces in person. Negotiating prices may be possible.\n\n*   **Estate Sales and Auctions:** Estate sales and auctions can be a good source for finding CorningWare, but be prepared for competition from other buyers.\n\n*   **Consignment Shops:** Some consignment shops specialize in vintage kitchenware and may be willing to sell your CorningWare on consignment.\n\n*   **Online Forums and Collector Groups:** Joining online forums or collector groups dedicated to CorningWare can provide valuable information and opportunities to buy or sell.\n\nWhen selling online, provide clear, high-quality photos and accurate descriptions of the item's condition, size, and any distinguishing features.\n\n**6. How should I care for my Blue Cornflower CorningWare to maintain its value?**\n\n**Answer:** Proper care is crucial for preserving the value of your Blue Cornflower CorningWare:\n\n*   **Gentle Cleaning:** Avoid abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch the surface. Use a mild dish soap and a soft sponge or cloth.\n\n*   **Hand Washing:** While CorningWare is dishwasher safe, hand washing is recommended to prevent damage to the pattern and prolong its lifespan.\n\n*   **Avoid Sudden Temperature Changes:** While CorningWare is resistant to temperature extremes, avoid taking it directly from the freezer to a hot oven, or vice versa. This sudden change can cause it to crack.\n\n*   **Proper Storage:** Store your CorningWare in a safe place where it won't be knocked or scratched. Consider using padded dividers to protect individual pieces.\n\n*   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect your CorningWare for any signs of damage, such as chips or cracks. Address any issues promptly to prevent further deterioration.\n\n*   **Avoid Metal Utensils:** Using metal utensils can scratch the surface of the CorningWare.\n\n**7. Is Blue Cornflower CorningWare still being made today?**\n\n**Answer:** No, the original Blue Cornflower CorningWare pattern, made from Pyroceram, is no longer in production. CorningWare transitioned to stoneware in the late 1990s and early 2000s. While CorningWare is still produced today under the Corelle Brands umbrella, the formula is different, and the original Blue Cornflower pattern is only available on the secondary market as vintage items. Corelle brands has released “inspired by” Blue Cornflower patterns on its stoneware, but these are not the same as the original Pyroceram pieces. This discontinuation contributes to the collectibility of the vintage Blue Cornflower pieces. For collectors, the focus is on finding the original, vintage Pyroceram pieces in good condition. These vintage pieces hold both nostalgic value and potential investment value, depending on their rarity and condition.\n",
