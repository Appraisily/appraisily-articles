Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on "antiques appraisal near me." Let's start by breaking down each of the user's eight points. 

First, understanding what antiques appraisal is and why it's important. From the search results, I see that appraisals determine value for insurance, taxes, estate planning, etc. The BBB directory in Cincinnati lists several local appraisers like Flashback and Frank Farmer Loomis, which I can use as examples. Also, sources [2], [3], and [4] explain the differences between evaluation, appraisal, and liquidation, which helps define the terms.

Next, the historical background. Source [19] mentions the history of appraisals dating back to the 1900s, but I need to connect that to antiques specifically. Maybe discuss how appraisal practices evolved with the growth of antique markets and professional organizations like ISA. Source [17] talks about the appraisal process, which could tie into historical methods versus modern techniques.

Types of appraisals: Sources [2] and [3] differentiate between evaluations, formal appraisals, and online appraisals. Also, [6] mentions verbal vs. written appraisals. I should categorize these into types like insurance, estate, and charitable appraisals, as mentioned in [12].

Factors affecting value: Source [5] lists six factors like condition, rarity, marks, demand, authenticity, and restoration. Source [18] adds provenance and craftsmanship. These are key points to include, maybe with examples from the search results.

Identifying authentic appraisers: Sources [8] and [12] suggest checking certifications (ISA, AAA), online reviews, and referrals. Also, attending local appraisal fairs or events. The BBB listings in [1] show accredited businesses, which can be an example of trusted sources.

Market trends: Source [7] discusses 2025 trends like antique tapestries and Art Nouveau pieces. Including these as current trends would be relevant. Also, mention online appraisals growing in popularity from [3] and [12].

Where to find appraisers: The BBB directory in [1] lists local options. Source [8] suggests online platforms and community events. [16] mentions Prestige Estate Services offering both online and in-person services. This section can include both local and online avenues.

Care and maintenance: Sources [9], [10], [13], [14], and [15] provide tips on environmental control, cleaning, storage, and avoiding harsh chemicals. Highlight specific advice like using beeswax polish, avoiding direct sunlight, and proper storage techniques.

I need to structure each section with headers, use examples from the sources, and cite them properly. Make sure each part flows logically and covers all aspects the user requested. Also, check that all citations are correctly referenced from the provided search results.
