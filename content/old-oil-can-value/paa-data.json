Condition is paramount; cans with minimal rust, dents, or scratches command higher prices.

Rarity plays a significant role; cans from defunct oil companies, specific promotions, or limited production runs are often highly sought after. The brand is also a factor; brands like Pennzoil, Sinclair, and Gulf are popular among collectors.

The label is another key area to scrutinize. Look for inconsistencies in the font, colors, or graphics compared to known examples of authentic cans.\n\nPay close attention to the condition of the can; reproductions often have artificially aged surfaces that appear unnatural. Examine the rust and wear patterns; genuine wear typically occurs in specific areas, while artificially aged cans may have random or uniform wear.
