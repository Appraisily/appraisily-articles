      "snippet": "The cylindrical-shaped oil cans became commonplace in the 1940's. These round cans have a soldered lead-seam and were standard from the 1920's to the 1940's. The first aluminum cans for motor oil were made in 1958. Round plastic oil cans date to the 1960's.",

      "question": "What were vintage oil cans used for?",
      "snippet": "An oil can (oilcan or oiler) is a can that holds oil (usually motor oil) for lubricating machines. An oil can can also be used to fill oil-based lanterns. An occupation, referred to as an oiler, can use an oil can (among other tools) to lubricate machinery.",

      "question": "When did they stop making metal oil cans?",
      "snippet": "In the 1980s, Eagle introduced blow-molded plastic gas and oil containers. The cost of producing plastic containers was significantly less than metal containers, and so Eagle launched its first line of plastic fuel containers in 1986.",

      "question": "What do the numbers mean on oil cans?",
      "snippet": "For example, if the oil is 5W-30, “5W” describes the oil's viscosity at low temperatures. The lower the number, the faster the oil will flow at vehicle start-up. The “30” represents the oil's viscosity at normal engine temperatures or when your vehicle has been warmed up.",
