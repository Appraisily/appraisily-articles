Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on old corn sheller value. Let's start by breaking down the user's query into the eight specific aspects they mentioned. 

First, understanding what old corn sheller value means. From the search results, it seems like value is determined by factors like age, manufacturer, condition, and historical significance. For example, the 1800s "Standard" corn sheller from Kentucky is priced at $274.99[1], while another from Pennsylvania with original stencil work was auctioned[10]. So, value isn't just monetary; it's also about historical and collectible importance.

Next, the historical background. The search results mention that corn shellers were virtually unknown before 1850[2], with Augustus Adams developing the spring sheller in the 1850s. Deere & Co. entered the market around 1900[2], and there's info on patents like the 1876 Lewis box sheller[3]. I should outline the evolution from hand-shelling to mechanical devices, highlighting key manufacturers and technological advancements.

Types and variations: The results list different models like spring-jaw, cylinder, hand-cranked, and multi-functional shellers. For instance, the Shaker-style sheller from 1850-70[3] and the horse-powered models[2]. Categorizing them by mechanism (spring vs. cylinder), power source (hand-cranked vs. horse-powered), and design (box vs. table-mounted) would make sense.

Determining factors: Condition is crucial. The "Standard" sheller shows expected wear but is solid[1], while the Pennsylvania #3 has original stencil work[10]. Rarity and provenance matter too, like the Wilson's 1875 patent sheller being rare[11]. Manufacturer reputation, like Belknap Hardware[1], also affects value.

Identifying authenticity: Look for patents, manufacturer stamps, and construction materials. The "Standard" logo's wear[1] and mortise-and-tenon construction in some models[3] are indicators. Provenance documentation, like auction details[10], helps verify authenticity.

Market trends: Prices vary widely. The Tiffin sheller was discussed in a forum with estimates around $100-200[9], while rare models like the Black Hawk sign sold for higher[12]. Auctions and online platforms like Alibaba[7] and BigIron[14] are current marketplaces. Trends show interest in restored vs. original condition pieces.

Buying/selling venues: Auctions (Apple Tree Auction[10], BigIron[14]), online marketplaces (Alibaba[7], farmcollector articles[2][3]), and specialized dealers[11]. Collectors' forums and shows are also mentioned[13].

Maintenance tips: Cleaning, rust prevention, and proper storage are key. The corn thresher maintenance guide[8] suggests lubrication, checking parts, and storing in dry conditions. Original parts preservation vs. restoration is a consideration for value retention.

I need to structure all this into sections, cite sources appropriately, and ensure each part flows into the next. Make sure to avoid lists, use headers correctly, and maintain an academic tone. Also, check that all data points from the search results are accurately referenced with the right citations. Let me start drafting each section, ensuring each paragraph connects and builds on the previous one, citing sources as I go.

## Historical Background and Development of Corn Shellers  

### Early Innovations in Agricultural Mechanization  
Corn shellers emerged in the mid-19th century as labor-saving devices, replacing manual shelling methods that required rubbing ears against rough surfaces or using handheld tools. Prior to 1850, corn shellers were virtually unknown[2]. The industry began with Augustus Adams’ spring sheller design in the 1850s, which utilized a spring-loaded plate to press ears against a knobby shelling wheel[2]. This innovation marked a shift toward mechanized farming, reducing the time required to process corn for feed, seed, or market.  

By the late 1800s, companies like Deere & Mansur and Marseilles Manufacturing Co. entered the market, refining designs for efficiency. Deere’s No. 2 sheller, introduced around 1900, and the Marseilles Cyclone self-feed sheller (1887) exemplified advancements, offering features like cob stackers and grain elevators[2]. These machines could shell 200–300 bushels daily when paired with horse power[2], revolutionizing agricultural productivity.  

### Technological Evolution and Patent Activity  
The late 19th century saw a surge in patent activity, with inventors refining mechanisms for durability and ease of use. For example, J.E. Lewis’ 1876 patent (No. 178,536) introduced spring-loaded jaws for separating kernels[3], while James Hawley’s 1877 design (No. 187,850) featured dual handles for ergonomic operation[3]. Manufacturers also experimented with materials, transitioning from wooden components to cast iron and steel, which improved longevity[1][3].

## Types and Variations of Antique Corn Shellers  

### Classification by Mechanism  
1. **Spring-Jaw Shellers**: These models, such as the Hawley sheller, used spring-loaded plates to grip ears and strip kernels. They were ideal for small-scale operations and often featured hand-cranked operation[3].  
2. **Cylinder Shellers**: Employing rotating cylinders with raised teeth, these machines, like the Marseilles Cyclone, automated kernel removal and were suited for high-volume processing[2].  
3. **Box Shellers**: Compact table-mounted units, such as the Lewis box sheller, directed kernels into a trough while ejecting cobs through a tube[3].  

### Power Sources and Design  
- **Hand-Cranked Models**: Portable and affordable, these shellers, like the Pennsylvania #3[10], were common on small farms.  
- **Horse-Powered Systems**: Larger machines, such as Deere’s No. 2, utilized animal power for increased output[2].  
- **Multi-Functional Units**: Later models could process soybeans, wheat, and millet, broadening their utility[6].
