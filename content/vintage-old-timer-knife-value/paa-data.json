What factors determine the value of a vintage Old Timer knife?**\n\n**Answer:** Several key factors influence the value of a vintage Old Timer knife. Understanding these factors is crucial for both collectors and those looking to sell.\n\n*   **Condition:** This is paramount. A knife in mint or near-mint condition, with minimal wear, scratches, or blade damage, will fetch a significantly higher price than one with heavy use. Look for original sheaths and packaging, as these add value.\n*   **Rarity:** Certain Old Timer models were produced in limited quantities or for specific periods. These rare models are highly sought after by collectors. Examples include early tang stamps or variations in handle materials.\n*   **Model Number:** Some models are inherently more valuable than others. The larger Stockman knives, like the 34OT, and certain Trapper models tend to command higher prices than smaller models. Referencing a reliable price guide or online auction history will help identify desirable models.\n*   **Tang Stamps:** The tang stamp, the marking on the blade near the handle, can indicate the age and manufacturer. Variations in the stamp (fonts, placement, text) can signify different production periods and affect value. Old Timer knives with \"Schrade+\" tang stamps, indicating the use of Schrade's proprietary steel, can sometimes be worth slightly more.\n*   **Handle Material:** While most Old Timers feature Staglon (imitation stag), variations in color and quality exist. Unusual or particularly attractive Staglon can add a small premium.\n*   **Box and Papers:** Having the original box, warranty card, and any accompanying paperwork dramatically increases value, especially for knives in excellent condition.\n\n**2. How can I identify an authentic vintage Old Timer knife?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying an authentic vintage Old Timer knife requires careful observation and attention to detail. Counterfeit Old Timers are relatively rare, but understanding the characteristics of genuine knives is essential.\n\n*   **Tang Stamps:** Carefully examine the tang stamp. It should be crisp, clear, and match the expected stamp for the model and era. Compare it to known authentic examples found online or in reference books.\n*   **Handle Material:** Authentic Old Timers predominantly use Staglon, a synthetic material designed to resemble stag. The texture and color should be consistent with Staglon. Check for any signs of cheap plastic or poor craftsmanship.\n*   **Blade Steel:** Schrade used specific types of steel in their Old Timer knives. While difficult to verify without specialized equipment, the blade should feel sturdy and hold an edge reasonably well.\n*   **Construction Quality:** Schrade knives were generally well-made, even the more affordable Old Timer line. Look for tight tolerances, even blade alignment, and a solid feel. Poorly made knives are a red flag.\n*   **Patent Numbers:** Some Old Timer knives have patent numbers stamped on the blade or bolster. Verify these numbers to ensure they match the knife's features and era.\n*   **Sheath (if present):** The sheath should be made of good quality leather or nylon, with secure stitching and a snug fit for the knife. Check for the Old Timer logo or branding on the sheath.\n*   **Consult Reputable Sources:** Compare your knife to images and descriptions in reliable sources, such as knife collecting websites, forums, and books.\n\n**3. What are some common Old Timer knife models and their approximate values?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the approximate value of common Old Timer models can be challenging, as prices fluctuate based on condition and demand. Here are a few examples, along with estimated values in good to excellent condition (without boxes):\n\n*   **34OT Middleman Stockman:** One of the most common Old Timer models. Value typically ranges from $15 to $40.\n*   **194OT Gunstock Trapper:** A popular model, often selling for $20 to $50.\n*   **8OT Senior Stockman:** Larger stockman model. Expect to pay $25 to $60.\n*   **108OT Junior Stockman:** Smaller stockman model. Typically valued between $15 and $35.\n*   **15OT Deerslayer:** A fixed-blade hunting knife. Values range from $30 to $75, depending on condition and whether it includes the original sheath.\n\nThese are just estimates. Checking completed listings on eBay and other online auction sites is the best way to get a sense of current market prices. Remember to factor in the specific condition of the knife when assessing its value. Knives with original boxes can command a premium of 25% to 50% or more.\n\n**4. Where can I buy or sell vintage Old Timer knives?**\n\n**Answer:** Several avenues exist for buying and selling vintage Old Timer knives, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\n*   **eBay:** A popular online marketplace with a vast selection of Old Timer knives. Be sure to research sellers and examine photos carefully before bidding or buying.\n*   **Online Knife Forums:** Many knife collecting forums have \"for sale\" sections where members buy, sell, and trade knives. These forums often offer a more knowledgeable and trustworthy environment than general online marketplaces.\n*   **Knife Shows:** Attending knife shows is a great way to see a wide variety of Old Timer knives in person and connect with other collectors.\n*   **Antique Stores and Flea Markets:** You might find hidden gems at local antique stores or flea markets, but prices can be inconsistent, and expertise may be limited.\n*   **Estate Sales:** Estate sales can be a good source for finding vintage knives, often at reasonable prices.\n*   **Consignment Shops:** Some consignment shops specialize in antiques and collectibles and may be willing to sell your Old Timer knives on consignment.\n\nWhen selling, providing accurate descriptions and high-quality photos is crucial. When buying, thoroughly inspect the knife before committing to a purchase.\n\n**5. What does the tang stamp on an Old Timer knife tell me?**\n\n**Answer:** The tang stamp on an Old Timer knife is a vital clue to its age and origin. It is the marking on the blade's base, usually near the handle. Key things the tang stamp reveals include:\n\n*   **Manufacturer:** Typically, the tang stamp will clearly state \"Schrade\" or \"Schrade Walden,\" indicating the knife was manufactured by Schrade Cutlery Corporation.\n*   **Model Number:** The model number of the knife is usually stamped on the tang, allowing you to identify the specific model.\n*   **Location:** Earlier Schrade knives might have \"Walden, N.Y.\" on the tang, indicating they were made in Walden, New York. Later knives might have \"U.S.A.\" or simply \"Schrade U.S.A.\"\n*   **Steel Type:** Some Old Timer knives have a \"Schrade+\" tang stamp, which indicates they were made with Schrade's proprietary stainless steel.\n*   **Variations:** Subtle variations in the font, placement, or wording of the tang stamp can indicate different production periods. For example, a tang stamp with \"Schrade Walden N.Y. USA\" is older than one that simply says \"Schrade U.S.A.\"\n*   **After Bankruptcy:** After Schrade's bankruptcy in 2004, the brand name was purchased, and knives bearing the \"Old Timer\" name were produced overseas. These knives will often have tang stamps indicating a foreign origin (e.g., China) or lack a Schrade marking altogether.\n\nResearching tang stamp variations is crucial for dating and authenticating Old Timer knives.\n\n**6. How should I care for and maintain a vintage Old Timer knife?**\n\n**Answer:** Proper care and maintenance are essential to preserve the value and functionality of a vintage Old Timer knife.\n\n*   **Cleaning:** After each use, wipe the blade clean with a soft cloth. For tougher residue, use a mild soap and water solution, but be sure to dry the knife thoroughly afterward.\n*   **Oiling:** Regularly apply a thin coat of knife oil (mineral oil is a good option) to the blade and pivot points to prevent rust and corrosion.\n*   **Sharpening:** Keep the blade sharp with a sharpening stone or steel. Use a consistent angle and light pressure to avoid damaging the blade.\n*   **Storage:** Store the knife in a dry place, preferably in a sheath or case, to protect it from moisture and dust.\n*   **Handle Care:** Occasionally clean the Staglon handle with a damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the material.\n*   **Avoid Over-Polishing:** While polishing can improve the appearance of the blade, excessive polishing can remove metal and diminish the knife's value.\n*   **Repair Carefully:** If the knife needs repair, seek out a qualified knife repair professional to avoid damaging it further.\n\n**7. What are some common issues or problems with vintage Old Timer knives?**\n\n**Answer:** Several common issues can affect vintage Old Timer knives, impacting their value and usability. Being aware of these problems can help you assess a knife's condition and make informed decisions.\n\n*   **Rust and Corrosion:** This is a common problem, especially if the knife has been stored improperly. Look for rust on the blade, bolsters, and internal components.\n*   **Blade Play:** Loose blades can be a sign of wear or damage to the pivot point. Check for excessive side-to-side or up-and-down movement.\n*   **Cracked or Damaged Handles:** Staglon handles can crack or chip, particularly if they have been exposed to extreme temperatures or impact.\n*   **Broken or Missing Springs:** The springs that operate the blades can break or weaken over time, affecting the knife's functionality.\n*   **Worn Blades:** Heavy use can cause the blade to become dull, scratched, or even broken.\n*   **Tampering or Modifications:** Knives that have been modified or altered may be less desirable to collectors.\n*   **Missing Parts:** Check for missing parts, such as shields, bolsters, or blade stops.\n\nWhen evaluating a vintage Old Timer knife, carefully inspect it for these common issues. Addressable issues (like rust) can be factored into the price, but severe damage or missing parts can significantly reduce the knife's value.\n",
