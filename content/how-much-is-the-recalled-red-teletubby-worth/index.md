Okay, so I need to figure out how much the recalled red Teletubby doll, specifically the Po doll, is worth. Let me start by understanding why this doll was recalled. From the search results, it looks like there was a controversy in 1998 where parents reported that the Po doll was saying inappropriate phrases like "faggot" and "bite my butt." The manufacturer claimed it was a misunderstanding of Cantonese phrases like "faster, faster." This led to a recall, making the doll a collector's item.

Now, to determine its current value, I should look at the factors that affect collectible toys. Rarity is a big one—since it was recalled, there might be fewer units available. The condition of the doll (new in box vs. used) would matter. Original packaging and functionality (if it still talks) could increase value. Also, the notoriety from the recall adds to its desirability among collectors.

Looking at the search results, there are listings on Poshmark and other sites. For example, one listing on Poshmark has the Po doll in its original box, never opened, priced at $63. Another mentions a 15" plush toy from 1998 listed around $37. However, some sold listings might give a better idea of actual market value. The YouTube videos and articles mention the recall, which could drive up prices due to its infamous history.

I should also consider how the recall's story impacts the value. Collectors often seek items with unique histories, especially those involved in public controversies. The Teletubbies franchise's popularity adds to the doll's recognition, even if the specific doll was recalled. Additionally, the presence of original packaging and any documentation related to the recall (like language cards inserted later) could affect the price.

Different variations might exist, such as differences in manufacturing years or regions. For instance, some dolls might have been produced before the recall, while others after, with modifications. Authenticity is crucial, so verifying the doll's features against known recalled versions is important. The original voice mechanism and phrases would be key identifiers.

Market trends show that vintage toys, especially those with a story, can appreciate. The Teletubby Po doll's value might have increased over time, especially as nostalgia for 90s toys grows. Platforms like eBay, Poshmark, and specialty toy stores are common places to find such items. Auctions or collector forums might also be sources.

Preservation tips would include keeping the doll in its original packaging, avoiding exposure to sunlight to prevent fading, and ensuring the electronic components are maintained (like removing batteries to prevent corrosion). Proper storage conditions are essential to preserve both the doll's physical condition and its functionality.

In summary, the recalled red Teletubby Po's value is influenced by its rarity, condition, historical significance from the recall, and collector demand. Prices vary based on these factors, with mint-in-box specimens fetching higher prices. Authenticity verification and understanding market platforms are key for buyers and sellers.

# The Value and Collectibility of the Recalled Red Teletubby "Po" Doll  

## Summary of Key Findings  
The recalled red Teletubby "Po" doll, part of the 1990s *Teletubbies* franchise, gained notoriety due to allegations of vocalizing offensive phrases, leading to its discontinuation. Its value stems from rarity, historical significance in toy recalls, and nostalgia-driven collector markets. Authentic specimens in original packaging with functional voice boxes command premium prices, often ranging from **$30 to $300+**, depending on condition and provenance.

## Historical Background and Recall Context  
### Origins of the Teletubbies Franchise  
The *Teletubbies* television series, created by Anne Wood and Andrew Davenport in 1997, became a global phenomenon targeting toddlers. The four characters—Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa, and Po—were merchandised extensively, with Po (the red Teletubby) becoming central to a 1998 controversy[4][7].  

### The 1998 Recall Incident  
Parents reported that squeezing Po’s belly triggered phrases perceived as **“faggot, faggot”** and **“bite my butt”**[1][2][8]. Manufacturer Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co. attributed the misunderstanding to a Cantonese voice actor’s lines (“faster, faster” and “slower, slower”)[1][16]. Despite this, the doll was recalled, cementing its status as a cultural curiosity[5][12].

   - Often marked “Made in China” with Cantonese vocalizations[10][12].  

2. **Post-Recall Revisions**:
