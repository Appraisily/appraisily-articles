Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on "antique furniture appraisers near me." Let's start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to ensure I cover everything thoroughly.

First, understanding what antique furniture appraisers are and their importance. From the search results, it's clear that appraisers assess age, condition, origin, and value. They help with insurance, estate planning, and sales. The importance lies in accurate valuations for financial and legal purposes. Sources like [1] and [3] mention certifications and the process involved.

Next, historical background. The search results don't provide a detailed history, but [2] and [4] mention companies with decades of experience, indicating the profession has been around for a long time, evolving with market needs. Maybe touch on how appraisal practices have standardized over time with organizations like ISA and AAA.

Types or categories of appraisers. The results mention certified vs. non-certified, specialists vs. generalists, and auction house appraisers vs. independent ones. For example, [5] talks about certifications from ISA and AAA, while [2] and [4] highlight auction houses offering appraisals. Also, online vs. in-person services, as seen in [11].

Factors determining value. The appraiser's expertise, certifications, access to market data, and tools used. Sources [1], [3], and [9] discuss factors like condition, provenance, and market trends. Also, the appraiser's reputation and client reviews, as mentioned in [6].

Identifying authentic appraisers. Look for certifications, check reviews, and ask for sample reports. [6] and [9] emphasize certifications from recognized bodies and the importance of physical inspections. Also, avoiding conflicts of interest, like appraisers who also deal in sales, as noted in [1].

Market trends and pricing. The search results mention a shift towards high-quality or provenance-rich pieces, with reproductions affecting the market [11]. Pricing might depend on the appraiser's credentials and location. [5] and [7] note varying fees based on appraisal type.

Where to find appraisers. Local auction houses, online directories like ISA, appraisal fairs, and recommendations. [6] suggests online platforms and local events, while [2] and [4] are examples of local auction houses offering services.

Care and maintenance tips. While the query is about appraisers, the user included a section on care. The search results [15], [16], [17], [18] provide tips on cleaning, humidity control, and avoiding direct sunlight. Even though it's about furniture care, it's part of the user's request, so include it, maybe linking proper care to maintaining appraisal value.

I need to structure each section with headers, use examples from the sources, and cite appropriately. Make sure to cover all eight points, using the provided search results for each part. Also, check for any missing aspects and ensure the flow is logical. Avoid duplications and ensure each section is comprehensive with relevant data points.
