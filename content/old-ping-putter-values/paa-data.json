What makes an old PING putter valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** The value of an old PING putter is determined by a confluence of factors, making it a fascinating area for collectors. The most significant determinants include rarity, condition, model, and whether it possesses any historical significance.\n\n*   **Rarity:** Certain PING putter models were produced in limited quantities or for a short duration, making them scarcer and more desirable. Examples include early Ansers with particular milling patterns or those produced with specific materials.\n*   **Condition:** As with any collectible, condition is paramount. A putter in excellent, original condition will fetch a significantly higher price than one with heavy wear, modifications, or rust.\n*   **Model:** The Anser, in its various iterations, is consistently sought after. However, rarer models like the Scottsdale Anser, early Zing models, or those with unique stamping features can command a premium.\n*   **Historical Significance:** Putters used by professional golfers, or those associated with significant tournaments, can be exceptionally valuable. Provenance, or a documented history of ownership, is crucial in these cases.\n*   **Material:** The material used in the putter's construction can also influence value. For instance, putters made from manganese bronze are generally more sought after than those made from zinc alloys. The presence of a \"Pat. Pend.\" marking on older models is another indicator of potential value.\n\nEssentially, a combination of low production numbers, pristine condition, a popular model, and a verifiable history dramatically increases an old PING putter's value.\n\n**2. How can I identify an old PING putter and determine its model?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying an old PING putter involves a close examination of several key features. The first step is to locate the PING logo, which is usually stamped on the head and sometimes on the shaft.\n\n*   **Look for Markings:** Pay close attention to any other markings, including model names (e.g., Anser, Pal, Zing), patent numbers (e.g., \"Pat. Pend.\" or specific patent numbers), and the city where it was manufactured (e.g., Scottsdale, Arizona). The absence of \"Made in USA\" can sometimes indicate a pre-1967 model, potentially increasing its value.\n*   **Head Shape and Design:** The shape of the putter head is a major clue. Compare your putter to online resources, such as PING's official website or collector's guides, which often have detailed images and descriptions of various models. Note the presence of any unique milling patterns, sole plates, or other distinguishing features.\n*   **Shaft and Grip:** While often replaced, the original shaft and grip can provide valuable information. Look for the original PING grip, which may have a distinctive texture or logo. The shaft band, if present, can also indicate the putter's age and model.\n*   **Serial Numbers:** Some PING putters have serial numbers, although they are not always present. If you find one, try contacting PING customer service; they may be able to provide information about the putter's origin and manufacturing date.\n*   **Online Resources:** Websites dedicated to golf collectibles and forums focused on PING putters are invaluable resources. Posting clear photos of your putter on these platforms can elicit helpful insights from experienced collectors.\n\nBy carefully examining these elements, you can significantly increase your chances of accurately identifying your old PING putter.\n\n**3. What is the approximate value range for old PING Anser putters?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the value range for old PING Anser putters is complex, as prices fluctuate significantly based on the factors mentioned earlier. However, a general approximation can be provided.\n\n*   **Common Anser Models (Fair Condition):** More common Anser models in fair condition (showing signs of use but still functional) might fetch anywhere from $50 to $150. These are typically later models or those with significant wear.\n*   **Rare Anser Models (Good Condition):** Rarer Anser models, such as the Scottsdale Anser or those with specific milling patterns, in good condition can range from $200 to $500 or more.\n*   **Exceptional Condition or Rare Variations:** Putters in exceptional condition or with rare variations (e.g., unique stampings, specific materials) can command prices exceeding $500, potentially reaching into the thousands of dollars for highly sought-after examples.\n*   **Factors Affecting Price:** Remember that the presence of original components (grip, shaft band), documented history, and provenance can significantly impact the price.\n*   **Online Marketplaces:** Checking completed listings on eBay and other online marketplaces is a good way to gauge current market values. However, be aware that asking prices are not always indicative of actual selling prices.\n\nIt's crucial to get a professional appraisal from a reputable golf collectible expert for a more accurate valuation, especially if you believe you have a particularly rare or valuable putter.\n\n**4. Where can I buy or sell old PING putters?**\n\n**Answer:** Several avenues exist for buying and selling old PING putters, each with its advantages and disadvantages.\n\n*   **eBay:** eBay is a popular platform for buying and selling vintage golf equipment, including PING putters. It offers a wide selection and a large audience, but it's important to be cautious of potential scams and to carefully examine photos and descriptions before bidding or buying.\n*   **Golf Collectible Auctions:** Specialized golf collectible auctions, both online and in-person, are excellent venues for buying and selling high-value putters. These auctions often attract serious collectors and offer a higher level of expertise and authentication.\n*   **Golf Forums and Online Communities:** Online golf forums dedicated to vintage equipment provide a space for enthusiasts to buy, sell, and trade putters directly. This can be a good option for finding specific models or getting advice from experienced collectors.\n*   **Local Golf Shops and Antique Stores:** While less common, some local golf shops or antique stores may carry vintage PING putters. This can be a good way to find a hidden gem, but selection is usually limited.\n*   **Consignment:** Consigning your putter to a reputable dealer specializing in vintage golf equipment can be a good option if you're not comfortable selling it yourself. The dealer will handle the marketing and sale, but you'll typically pay a commission.\n\nWhen buying or selling, always do your research, ask questions, and be aware of potential risks. Authentication is crucial when dealing with valuable putters.\n\n**5. What are some common problems or challenges when collecting old PING putters?**\n\n**Answer:** Collecting old PING putters, while rewarding, comes with its own set of challenges.\n\n*   **Authentication:** Counterfeit or altered putters are a real concern. Be wary of putters with suspicious markings, non-original components, or prices that seem too good to be true. Consulting with a reputable appraiser can help ensure authenticity.\n*   **Condition Assessment:** Accurately assessing the condition of a putter is crucial for determining its value. Be aware of common issues such as rust, dents, scratches, and modifications. Photos can be deceiving, so try to inspect the putter in person if possible.\n*   **Finding Rare Models:** Locating specific rare models can be a time-consuming and challenging process. Patience and persistence are key. Networking with other collectors and regularly checking online marketplaces can increase your chances of success.\n*   **Pricing Uncertainty:** Determining the fair market value of a putter can be difficult, especially for rare or unusual models. Prices can fluctuate based on demand and market trends. Consulting with appraisers and tracking completed sales can help you get a better sense of value.\n*   **Storage and Preservation:** Properly storing and preserving your putters is essential for maintaining their condition and value. Keep them in a dry, climate-controlled environment and avoid exposing them to extreme temperatures or humidity.\n\nBy being aware of these challenges and taking appropriate precautions, you can minimize risks and maximize your enjoyment of collecting old PING putters.\n\n**6. What is the significance of \"Scottsdale\" stamped on an old PING putter?**\n\n**Answer:** The \"Scottsdale\" stamping on an old PING putter holds significant historical and collectible value. It indicates that the putter was manufactured in Scottsdale, Arizona, during the company's early years.\n\n*   **Early Production:** PING was founded by Karsten Solheim in his garage in Redwood City, California, but later moved production to Scottsdale. Putters stamped \"Scottsdale\" are generally considered to be from the earlier production runs, typically before the late 1960s or early 1970s.\n*   **Rarity and Value:** Because of their age and the fact that Scottsdale-era putters represent a pivotal period in PING's history, they are often more sought after by collectors. This can translate to a higher value, especially for models in good condition.\n*   **Material Variations:** Some Scottsdale putters were made with different materials compared to later models, contributing to their unique feel and collectibility. For example, manganese bronze was a common material during this period.\n*   **Identifying Features:** Pay close attention to other features alongside the \"Scottsdale\" stamp, such as the presence of \"Pat. Pend.\" (patent pending) markings, which are also indicative of earlier production. The absence of \"Made in USA\" along with the Scottsdale stamp is another key identifier of potentially higher value.\n\nIn summary, the \"Scottsdale\" stamp is a valuable indicator of an old PING putter's age, origin, and potential collectibility.\n\n**7. Besides the Anser, what other old PING putter models are considered collectible?**\n\n**Answer:** While the Anser is arguably the most iconic and collected PING putter, several other models are highly sought after by enthusiasts.\n\n*   **PING Pal:** The Pal, another early design from Karsten Solheim, is a blade-style putter with a distinctive hosel design. Early Pal models, particularly those in good condition, are considered collectible.\n*   **PING 1-A:** The 1-A is a foundational model in PING's history, representing Karsten Solheim's initial foray into putter design. Early versions are rare and highly valued.\n*   **PING Zing:** The Zing, known for its distinctive cavity back design, was a popular model and early versions are now considered collectible, especially those with unique milling patterns or in exceptional condition.\n*   **PING Cushin:** The Cushin putter, with its insert designed to improve feel, also attracts collectors. Early Cushin models are less common and can be quite valuable.\n*   **PING B60:** While a later design, the B60, especially those with specific finishes or limited edition runs, has gained popularity among collectors.\n*   **Beyond specific models:** Beyond specific models, putters with unique stampings, custom modifications (especially those done by PING themselves), or those associated with professional golfers can also be highly collectible.\n\nWhen evaluating these models, remember that condition, rarity, and provenance are key factors in determining their value. Researching specific variations and consulting with experienced collectors can help you identify potentially valuable examples.\n",
