    "prompt": "Photorealistic macro shot focusing on the bases of three different antique glass bottles (aqua medicine, amber beer, clear soda) arranged horizontally on a weathered dark wood surface. Sharp focus highlights the intricate embossed maker's marks, lettering, and numbers on each base. Subtle imperfections like wear marks, seed bubbles, and slight iridescence are visible. Soft, directional studio lighting from the side casts gentle shadows, emphasizing the relief of the embossing and the texture of the glass. Shallow depth of field softly blurs the wood grain in the foreground and background. Professional, high-detail photography style. --ar 16:9 --style raw",

    "prompt": "Informative photorealistic comparison shot focusing on the neck and lip finish of two distinct 19th-century glass bottles side-by-side against a neutral, lightly textured grey backdrop. One bottle features a crudely applied lip, the other a more refined tooled lip. Sharp focus clearly shows the vertical mold seams running up the neck and how they terminate differently below each lip type. Details include slight glass impurities, whittle marks, and the texture difference between the bottle body and the lip finish. Clean, bright, diffused lighting from the front-left illuminates the glass structure without harsh reflections. Documentary style, high resolution. Composition places bottles slightly left of center in the 16:9 frame. --ar 16:9 --style raw",
