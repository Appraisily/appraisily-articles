  "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user with their research on old glass bottle identification. Let me start by understanding their query. They want a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects, from definitions to market trends. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each search result to gather relevant information. The user mentioned they're writing an in-depth article, so I need to ensure each section is detailed with examples and data. \n\nFor the first section, defining old glass bottle identification and its importance. From the sources, I see that identifying involves examining features like mold seams, pontil marks, embossing, and color. Importance includes historical value, collectibility, and monetary worth. Sources [1], [8], [9], [10], [11], [13], and [14] discuss these aspects. \n\nNext, historical background. Source [2] mentions glass bottles date back to pre-Roman times, with core-formed techniques. The Romans introduced glassblowing. The 19th century saw mold-blown techniques, and automation in the 20th century. Pontil marks from the 1800s and Owens machine marks post-1905 are key points from [8] and [11]. \n\nTypes and categories: Apothecary, liquor, milk, soda, ink bottles. Source [2] talks about apothecary vials, [4] about liquor bottles, [10] and [15] mention milk, soda, and ink. Different shapes and uses are covered here.\n\nFactors affecting value: Age, rarity, condition, brand, design. Source [4] has a table on brand and distillery impact, [15] gives price ranges. Pontil marks and mold seams from [1], [8], [11] indicate age. \n\nAuthenticity checks: Look for pontil marks, mold seams, embossing, color. Sources [1], [8], [9], [11], [13] provide details on these features. Reproductions might lack these or have modern markings.\n\nMarket trends: Source [4] and [6] mention platforms like cabinet7 for appraisals and sales. Auction sites and specialized marketplaces are where bottles are traded. Price examples from [15] and [4] show ranges from $20 to $42,500.\n\nWhere to buy/sell: Auction houses, online platforms like 1stDibs [5], cabinet7 [6], antique shops. Maintenance tips from [7] and [12] include cleaning with warm water, avoiding harsh chemicals, proper storage.\n\nI need to structure each section with headers, include specific examples like pontil marks, apothecary vials, and use tables where applicable, like the value factors from [4]. Cite sources throughout, ensuring each claim is backed by the provided search results. Make sure the answer is comprehensive, covers all user points, and is well-organized with clear sections. Avoid any markdown except headers and bold where needed. Check for all eight aspects the user mentioned to ensure nothing is missed.\n</think>\n\nDetermining the age and authenticity of old glass bottles involves analyzing manufacturing techniques, physical characteristics, and historical context. This field combines archaeology, material science, and collectibles markets, offering insights into historical trade patterns, consumer habits, and industrial evolution. Below is a structured analysis of key aspects in glass bottle identification:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Fundamentals of Glass Bottle Identification  \n**Definition**: The systematic examination of physical features (mold seams, pontil marks, embossing), materials, and manufacturing techniques to determine a bottle's age, origin, and purpose[1][8][11].  \n\n**Importance**:  \n- **Historical preservation**: Early bottles (pre-1900) document trade routes and apothecary practices[2][14].  \n- **Collector value**: Rare 19th-century pontiled medicines or Art Deco perfumes can exceed $1,000[4][15].  \n- **Archaeological significance**: Roman core-formed perfume bottles (500 BCE–400 CE) reveal ancient trade networks[2].  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Historical Development  \n- **Pre-19th century**: Hand-blown bottles with irregular shapes and pontil marks (iron rod scars on bases)[11].  \n- **1870–1910**: Mold-blown bottles with vertical seams; introduction of automatic bottle machines (Owens ring scars post-1905)[8].  \n- **Post-1920**: Machine-made uniformity, embossed logos (e.g., Coca-Cola’s 1915 contour bottle)[14].  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Categories and Variations  \n| **Type**         | **Key Features**                                  | **Era**          |  \n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|  \n| Apothecary       | Cobalt blue/green glass, faceted sides, cork stoppers | 1600s–1900s[2][14] |  \n| Liquor flasks    | Flat profiles, embossed distillery marks (e.g., \"Old Overholt\") | 1800s–1930s[4]   |  \n| Milk bottles     | Round bodies, wide mouths, dairy logos            | 1880s–1960s[10][15] |  \n| Sodas            | ACL (Applied Color Label) designs, crown tops     | 1890s–1970s[10]  |  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Value Determinants  \n**Key factors** (Source: [4][15]):  \n- **Rarity**: Pre-1870 free-blown medicines ($800–$1,500) vs. common 1950s beers ($5–$20).  \n- **Condition**: Chips reduce value by 50–75%; pristine labeled whiskeys (e.g., Prohibition-era) fetch $2,000+[4].  \n- **Provenance**: Bottles from closed distilleries (e.g., pre-1920s Scottish malts) command premiums[6].  \n\n**Case study**: A 1780s \"onion\" wine bottle with pontil mark sold for $1,200 vs. $150 for a 1900s replica[2][15].  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Authenticity Verification  \n- **Pontil marks**: Rough, ring-shaped bases indicate pre-1860 hand-blown bottles[11].  \n- **Mold seams**: Faint vertical lines stopping below the lip suggest pre-1910 production[1][8].  \n- **Embossing**: Match logos to known manufacturers (e.g., Whitall Tatum Co. marks 1870–1938)[13].  \n- **Color analysis**: Pre-1900 aqua glass vs. post-1920 clear glass due to manganese scarcity[9][14].  \n\n**Red flags**: Reproductions often lack mold lines or show modern \"Made in\" stamps[8][13].  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Market Trends (2025)  \n- **High demand**: Pre-Prohibition whiskeys (+30% since 2022), Art Nouveau perfumes ($500–$5,000)[5][6].  \n- **Emerging niches**: WWII-era poison bottles ($80–$200), mid-century Italian Murano designs ($150–$800)[3][15].  \n- **Auction records**: 1850s Baltimore amber bitters ($4,750), 1920s French Lalique vials ($42,500)[5].  \n\n---\n\n## 7. Acquisition and Sales Channels  \n- **Specialized platforms**: Cabinet7 (free appraisals), 1stDibs (pre-1900 apothecary: $200–$1,000)[5][6].  \n- **Physical markets**: Antique Trader shows (milk bottles: $10–$50), archaeological digs (Roman unguentaria: $300+)[3][15].  \n- **Authentication services**: Society for Historical Archaeology’s manufacturer mark database[8][13].  \n\n---\n\n## 8. Preservation Guidelines  \n- **Cleaning**: Use warm water + baking soda; avoid abrasive tools to prevent scratching[7][12].  \n- **Storage**: Keep in UV-filtered cases; stabilize temperature to prevent thermal stress[7].  \n- **Handling**: Support bases to avoid lip damage (weakest point in hand-blown specimens)[12].  \n\n---\n\nThis multidisciplinary field requires combining material analysis with historical research. As automation increased bottle production, earlier handmade examples became prized for their craftsmanship and scarcity, driving both academic and collector interest.",
