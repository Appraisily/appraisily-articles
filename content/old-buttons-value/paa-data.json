It's not simply about age; rarity, material, maker, and condition are crucial factors.  First, carefully examine the button's material.  Buttons made from unusual materials like porcelain, mother-of-pearl, glass (especially hand-blown or intricately colored), or specific types of metal (e.g.,  sterling silver, gold-filled) are generally more valuable. Next, look for maker's marks or identifying features.  Many manufacturers stamped their buttons, providing valuable clues about their origin and age.  Research these marks using online databases or button collecting books. The button's condition is paramount; chips, cracks, or significant wear significantly reduce value.  Finally, consider the button's design and historical context.  Buttons reflecting popular styles or events (e.g., Victorian era designs, military buttons) tend to command higher prices.  Use online resources like eBay's sold listings (to see what similar buttons have fetched) and specialized button collecting websites for comparative pricing.
