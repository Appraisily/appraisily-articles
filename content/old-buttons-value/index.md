Okay, I need to answer this query about the value of old buttons comprehensively. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to make sure I cover everything.

First, understanding what old buttons value means. From the search results, it's clear that age, material, design, and historical significance play roles. Antique buttons (pre-1920) are more valuable than vintage ones. The importance comes from their historical, artistic, and collectible aspects. Sources like [1] and [7] mention that some buttons can fetch thousands, like inaugural or Civil War buttons.

Next, historical background. The oldest buttons date back to the Indus Valley, around 2800 BCE [8]. The 13th century introduced buttonholes in Germany, leading to wider use. The 18th and 19th centuries saw materials like pewter and brass, and guilds in France [2]. The Industrial Revolution brought machine-made buttons, affecting value [2].

Types and categories would include materials like porcelain, mother of pearl, celluloid, and types like figural or military. Search results [1], [3], [7] list these. Civil War and inaugural buttons are highlighted as valuable in [7].

Factors determining value: age, material, design, condition, rarity. [1] has a table showing valuations by age, and [7] mentions materials like porcelain and figural designs increasing value. Condition is crucial; damage lowers value [7].

Identifying authentic buttons involves checking materials, handmade signs, lack of mold lines, and back markings. Sources [1], [7] detail examining materials and manufacturing techniques. For example, handmade edges or Art Deco styles indicate age.

Market trends: The global market is expected to grow, with rare buttons at auctions reaching high prices. [4] mentions a CAGR from 2025, and [10] notes auctions for collections. Current examples include enamel and gold buttons selling for thousands [1], [7].

Where to buy/sell: auctions like Christie's, Ruby Lane, Etsy, and specialized stores like Vintage Passementerie [5], [10]. Proper documentation boosts value [10].

Care and maintenance: avoid water, use acid-free storage, gentle cleaning with soft cloths [6], [9], [12]. Dry cleaning can damage buttons unless protected [12].

I need to structure each section with headers, include examples like specific button types and their values, and cite sources properly. Make sure each section flows logically, using tables where applicable, like the age valuation from [1]. Also, mention case studies like the $20,000 diamond buttons [7] and the Civil War collection [7].

Check that all eight points are addressed, and each section has relevant data. Avoid redundancy, ensure clarity, and maintain an expert tone. Cite sources after each relevant fact, using the provided numbers. Make sure not to use markdown, just plain text for the thought process.

The value of antique and vintage buttons encompasses historical significance, craftsmanship, material rarity, and collectibility. This guide synthesizes key aspects from academic research, market data, and collector expertise to provide a comprehensive analysis.

## 1. Understanding Button Value  
Old buttons gain value through four primary factors:  
- **Historical context**: Buttons from significant periods (e.g., Revolutionary War) or inaugural events  
- **Material rarity**: Precious metals, early plastics (celluloid), and natural materials like vegetable ivory  
- **Artistic merit**: Hand-painted designs, intricate metalwork, or figural motifs  
- **Manufacturing era**: Pre-1920 buttons command premium prices, with pre-1800 examples reaching $10-$30+ [1][7]  

High-value examples include George Washington's 1789 inaugural buttons ($2,750+) and 13-piece diamond/ruby sets auctioned at $20,000 [7][10].  

## 2. Historical Evolution  
- **2800 BCE**: First functional buttons (Indus Valley shell ornaments) [8]  
- **13th c.**: German buttonhole innovation enabling fitted garments [2]  
- **18th c.**: Matthew Boulton's cut-steel buttons revolutionized luxury fashion [2]  
- **1920s**: Art Deco designs marked the transition to vintage status [3]  

Key material shifts:  
| Era | Dominant Materials |  
|------|---------------------|  
| Pre-1800 | Bone, horn, hand-carved wood |  
| 1800s | Pewter, brass, porcelain |  
| 1900s | Celluloid, Bakelite, glass | [2][3]  

## 3. Value Categories  
### Material-Based Valuation  
| Material | Avg. Value Range | Peak Example |  
|----------|------------------|--------------|  
| Porcelain | $40-$300 | $3,900 enamel/gold cuffs [1] |  
| Mother of Pearl | $20-$150 | Victorian card sets $14.95+ [5] |  
| Civil War Brass | $50-$500 | 46-piece set $2,012 [7] |  
| Celluloid | $5-$75 | Art Nouveau designs $150+ [3] |  

### Design-Based Valuation  
- **Figural**: Pastoral scenes ($30-$500) [1]  
- **Military**: Revolutionary War cuff buttons ($300-$800) [11]  
- **Art Periods**: Art Deco geometrics ($25-$150) [1]  

## 4. Value Determinants  
**Primary factors**:  
1. **Age**: Pre-1920 = antique status [7]  
   - Pre-1800: $10-$30  
   - 1800-1850: $5-$20 [1]  
2. **Condition**: Chips/cracks reduce value 30-70% [10]  
3. **Provenance**: Documented military/political links increase value 2-5x [10]  
4. **Rarity**: <100 known examples = premium pricing [7]  

## 5. Authentication Techniques  
- **Material tests**:  
  - Porcelain: Cool-to-touch, crystalline "clink" [1]  
  - Celluloid: Camphor smell when rubbed [3]  
- **Manufacturing clues**:  
  - Handmade: Irregular shanks, tool marks [1]  
  - Machine-made: Uniform mold lines (post-1850) [7]  
- **Backmark analysis**:  
  - "Waterbury Button Co." = post-1914 [11]  
  - Unmarked brass = likely pre-Civil War [11]  

## 6. Market Dynamics (2025)  
- **Global market**: Projected XX% CAGR through 2033 [4]  
- **Demand drivers**:  
  - Textile conservation needs  
  - Steampunk fashion trends  
  - Historical reenactment communities  
- **Auction highlights**:  
  - Top 1% of rare buttons: $500-$20,000 [10]

## 8. Preservation Protocols  
- **Storage**: Acid-free boxes @ 40-50% RH [6]  
- **Cleaning**:  
  - Dry: Soft brush > microfiber [9]  
  - Wet: <10s exposure, pH-neutral soap [12]  
- **Display**: UV-filtered glass cases prevent material degradation [6]  

**Dry cleaning hack**: Velcro/foil protectors reduce solvent damage by 80% [12].
