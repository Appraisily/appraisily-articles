What factors determine the value of a vintage Old Timer pocket knife?**\n\n**Answer:** The value of a vintage Old Timer pocket knife hinges on several key factors. Condition is paramount; a knife in mint, unused condition with its original box will command a significantly higher price than one with scratches, rust, or missing parts. Rarity also plays a crucial role. Some Old Timer models were produced in limited quantities or for specific periods, making them more desirable to collectors. Specific tang stamps, referring to the markings on the blade near the pivot point, can indicate the year of manufacture and potentially identify rare variations. For example, certain early Schrade Walden tang stamps are highly sought after.\n\nHandle materials influence value. While the standard Sawcut Delrin handles are common, stag, bone, or even celluloid handles can increase desirability. Finally, the model itself matters. Larger, more elaborate knives or those with unique features, like the Uncle Henry series or those with specific blade configurations, tend to be worth more. Always research the specific model number and look for comparable sales on reputable auction sites like eBay (completed listings) to gauge its market value. Remember to factor in shipping costs when assessing the final price.\n\n**2. How can I identify a genuine vintage Old Timer pocket knife?**\n\n**Answer:** Authenticating a vintage Old Timer knife requires careful examination. Start by scrutinizing the tang stamp. Schrade Cutlery used specific markings throughout its history. Research the different tang stamps and their corresponding production years. For example, the \"Schrade Walden N.Y. U.S.A.\" stamp indicates knives made before the company moved its factory. Examine the overall construction and materials. Old Timer knives are known for their robust build quality. Check for consistent fit and finish, and ensure the handle material (usually Sawcut Delrin) matches what's expected for that model.\n\nPay close attention to details like the bolster material (typically nickel silver) and the blade steel. The blade should be free of excessive rust or pitting, though some patina is acceptable on older knives. Be wary of knives with obvious signs of modification or replacement parts. Counterfeit Old Timer knives are relatively rare, but they do exist. If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Compare the knife you're considering to known examples in reputable online forums or collector guides. Also, consider the source. Buying from a trusted dealer or collector is generally safer than purchasing from an unknown seller.\n\n**3. What are some of the most valuable Old Timer pocket knife models?**\n\n**Answer:** Several Old Timer models are particularly coveted by collectors. The larger trappers, like the 194OT, can fetch higher prices, especially in excellent condition. The Uncle Henry series, particularly those with stag handles and unique blade configurations, are also desirable. Limited edition or commemorative Old Timer knives, often released for specific events or anniversaries, tend to be valuable due to their scarcity.\n\nKeep an eye out for Old Timer knives with unusual handle materials or blade etches. For example, knives with genuine stag handles or elaborate blade engravings can command a premium. Early production models, especially those with the Schrade Walden tang stamp, are also sought after. While it's difficult to provide exact prices without seeing specific examples, researching completed eBay listings for similar models can give you a general idea of their market value. Remember that condition is a major factor; even a rare model will be worth less if it's heavily damaged.\n\n**4. Where can I find reliable information on Old Timer pocket knife values?**\n\n**Answer:** Several resources can help you determine the value of your vintage Old Timer pocket knife.\n*   **eBay Completed Listings:** Search for your specific model and filter by \"Sold Items\" to see what similar knives have recently sold for. This provides real-world market data.\n*   **Knife Collector Forums:** Online forums dedicated to knife collecting, like BladeForums, are invaluable resources. Experienced collectors can offer insights and help identify rare variations.\n*   **Knife Dealer Websites:** Reputable knife dealers often have sections on their websites dedicated to vintage knives. While they may not always list prices, they can provide information on rarity and collectibility.\n*   **Knife Collecting Books:** While not always up-to-date on current market prices, books on knife collecting can provide historical context and information on specific models.\n*   **Appraisals:** Consider getting a professional appraisal from a qualified knife appraiser, especially for rare or high-value knives.\n*   **Old Timer Catalogs:** Original Old Timer catalogs can be extremely helpful in identifying models, tang stamps, and production years. These catalogs are often available for purchase online.\n\n**5. What is the difference between \"Old Timer\" and \"Uncle Henry\" knives, and how does it affect value?**\n\n**Answer:** Both \"Old Timer\" and \"Uncle Henry\" are product lines manufactured by Schrade Cutlery, but they differ in their target audience and design. Old Timer knives are generally considered to be more rugged and utilitarian, often featuring Sawcut Delrin handles and carbon steel blades. They're designed for everyday use and are known for their durability. Uncle Henry knives, on the other hand, are often considered to be more refined, sometimes featuring stag or wood handles, and often using stainless steel blades. They were marketed as being more suitable for dressier occasions.\n\nGenerally, Uncle Henry knives, especially those with stag handles or unique blade configurations, can command a higher price than comparable Old Timer models, *provided* they are in similar condition. The stag handles are a significant value driver. However, the \"Old Timer\" brand has a strong following, and some rare or early production Old Timer models can be just as valuable as, or even more valuable than, common Uncle Henry knives. Ultimately, the value depends on the specific model, condition, rarity, and the preferences of the buyer.\n\n**6. What are some common problems or issues to look for when evaluating a vintage Old Timer knife?**\n\n**Answer:** When evaluating a vintage Old Timer knife, be aware of several potential issues:\n*   **Blade Wobble:** Check for excessive play or wobble in the blade when it's open or closed. This can indicate wear or damage to the pivot pin.\n*   **Broken or Cracked Handles:** Inspect the handle material for cracks, chips, or breaks. Delrin handles can become brittle with age.\n*   **Rust and Pitting:** Look for rust or pitting on the blade, bolsters, and liners. Severe rust can significantly reduce the knife's value.\n*   **Sharpening Marks:** Excessive or uneven sharpening can damage the blade's profile and reduce its value.\n*   **Missing Parts:** Ensure all the original parts are present, including shields, bolsters, and liners. Missing parts can be difficult to replace.\n*   **Modified or Replaced Blades:** Check for signs of blade replacement or modification, such as mismatched tang stamps or inconsistent blade shapes.\n*   **Weak Springs:** Test the blade's snap. Weak springs can indicate wear or damage.\n\nAlways examine the knife carefully under good lighting and consider using a magnifying glass to inspect for subtle flaws.\n\n**7. Where is the best place to buy and sell vintage Old Timer pocket knives?**\n\n**Answer:** Several avenues exist for buying and selling vintage Old Timer pocket knives:\n\n*   **eBay:** eBay is a popular platform with a large selection of knives. Use the \"Sold Items\" filter to research prices and be sure to scrutinize seller feedback.\n*   **Knife Collector Forums:** Many forums have classifieds sections where members can buy, sell, and trade knives. This can be a good way to connect with knowledgeable collectors.\n*   **Gun Shows and Knife Shows:** These events offer the opportunity to inspect knives in person and negotiate prices.\n*   **Antique Stores and Flea Markets:** You might find hidden gems at antique stores and flea markets, but be prepared to do your research to ensure you're getting a fair price.\n*   **Reputable Knife Dealers:** Buying from a reputable dealer can provide peace of mind, but expect to pay a premium for their expertise and guarantee of authenticity.\n*   **Online Auction Houses:** Some auction houses specialize in collectibles, including knives. This can be a good option for selling high-value knives.\n\nWhen buying, always ask for detailed photos and descriptions, and don't hesitate to ask questions. When selling, be honest about the knife's condition and provide accurate descriptions. Using high-quality photos is crucial for attracting potential buyers.\n",
