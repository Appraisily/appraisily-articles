Okay, I need to tackle this query about old hubcaps identification. The user wants a comprehensive article covering several aspects. Let me start by breaking down each part of the query to ensure I cover everything.

First, understanding what old hubcaps identification is. From the search results, hubcaps have evolved from functional parts to collectibles. Identification involves determining the make, model, and year of a vehicle they belong to. Sources like [1] and [2] mention the historical shift from dust covers to style elements. Importance comes from restoration value and collectibility, as seen in [10] and [12].

Next, historical background. The search results [1], [2], and [8] discuss the origins in the late 17th century, transitioning to style in the 1930s with Cadillac's wheel covers. I should mention materials and design changes over time.

Types and variations. The results [10] and [16] talk about different manufacturers and designs. Maybe categorize by era, manufacturer, or material. For example, Cadillac's sombrero style from [8], or Ford's models in [17].

Factors affecting value. Rarity, condition, and manufacturer are key. Source [10] mentions rare models can fetch over $100, while common ones are under $10. NOS (New Old Stock) hubcaps like in [12] can be $1200-1400. Authenticity checks from [16] and [17] include logos and construction details.

Identifying authenticity. Reference sources like [16] where forums discuss emblems and construction. Also, [17] shows how experts ID based on design features. Mentioning resources like hubcaps.org from [16] would help.

Market trends. Sources [9] and [13] discuss regional growth and technological trends. Asia-Pacific's CAGR of 7% vs North America's 5%. Also, sustainability trends with materials like thermoplastics.

Buying/selling venues. Etsy [15], specialized sites like Hubcap Mike [7], auctions [11], and forums [14]. Maintenance tips from [6] include cleaning and storage.

Care and maintenance. Source [6] lists regular cleaning, avoiding harsh conditions, checking for damage, waxing, and proper storage.

I need to structure all this into sections with headers, using specific examples and data. Ensure each part is cited properly with the relevant sources. Avoid markdown in the thinking, but the final answer should follow the format rules. Check that all aspects of the query are covered and that the information flows logically.

## **1. What Is Old Hubcaps Identification?**
Hubcap identification involves determining the vehicle make, model, and production year a hubcap was designed for. This process is critical for:
