      "question": "Are old cameo brooches worth anything?",
      "snippet": "These rare facing cameos can be worth a lot of money. Women are used most often as subject matter in a cameo, but a man is worth more. Depictions of African American individuals are worth even more. Women with elaborate hair or hats, children, historical or mythical figures are highly prized by collectors.",

      "snippet": "The quality of paint and enamel used by vintage artisans is usually more durable than that used by counterfeit manufacturers nowadays. Real cameos were made to last, so the design should be fairly intact. This is also an indication of value. Scratched designs cause the value of the cameo to decrease.",

If the cameo is made from shell you should feel a concave or curve. The curve might be slight, but this is a good sign the cameo was carved from real shell.",
