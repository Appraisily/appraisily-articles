  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query about Garth's Auctioneers & Appraisers. The user wants a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects. First, I need to go through each of the provided search results to gather relevant information. \n\nStarting with question 1: What is Garth's and why is it important? From the search results, I see that Garth's is an auction house founded in 1954, specializing in American, Continental, and Asian items. They're noted as Ohio's oldest premier auction house with international reach and annual sales around $10 million. Their importance comes from their reputation, certified appraisers, and innovative marketing. The BBB profile mentions they've been around for 71 years, which adds to their credibility, even though they have an F rating due to complaints.\n\nFor the historical background (question 2), the Delaware County Historical Society link mentions Garth Oberlander founded it in 1954. Tom and Carolyn Porter took over in 1967, then Jeff and Amelia Jeffers in the mid-90s. There's also the acquisition of Selkirk Auctioneers in 2014, which expanded their reach. However, recent changes like Amelia Jeffers leaving and starting her own venture in 2023 are important to note.\n\nQuestion 3 about types or variations: Garth's offers various services like auctions, appraisals, estate services, and real estate. They handle different categories like furniture, fine art, folk art, etc. The Houzz page mentions international reach and different auction formats. Also, after 2014, they operated under both Garth's and Selkirk brands.\n\nFactors determining value (question 4) would include expertise of appraisers, marketing efforts, transparency, and location. The search results mention their certified appraisers, robust marketing, and Midwest location reducing overhead, which allows lower commissions. Authenticity (question 5) could be tied to their certifications, USPAP compliance, and reputation. The BBB complaints about unresponsiveness might be a cautionary note.\n\nMarket trends (question 6) need current data. The latest info from 2024 mentions Amelia Jeffers handling the Knight collection. The 2025 auction trends from external sources suggest a focus on online auctions and AI, but Garth's specific trends might relate to their sales performance and strategic moves like the Selkirk acquisition. However, the BBB's F rating and complaints could indicate some operational issues.\n\nWhere to buy/sell (question 7) would be through their auctions, both in-person and online. Their website and platforms like Invaluable or LiveAuctioneers are mentioned. After 2023, Amelia Jeffers' new venture at Garth's Barn is another venue.\n\nCare and maintenance (question 8) isn't directly addressed in the sources, but general advice for antiques would apply, like proper storage and insurance. Garth's estate services might offer assistance here.\n\nI need to structure each section with headings, use specific examples like the Knight collection sale, and include data points like annual sales figures. Also, note the ownership changes and recent developments. Make sure to cite sources appropriately, like the BBB for complaints, Rare Book Hub for sales stats, and the Delaware historical society for founding info. Avoid mentioning the BBB rating negatively but present the facts. Highlight their certifications and USPAP compliance for appraisals. Mention the shift in appraisal services to Amelia Jeffers post-2017. Current market trends should tie into broader industry movements like online auctions and AI, even if Garth's specific 2025 data is limited. Ensure each section answers the query point clearly with relevant info from the sources.\n</think>\n\nGarth's Auctioneers & Appraisers represents a significant institution in the North American antiques and fine art market.
