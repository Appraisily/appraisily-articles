How can I determine the age of my old RC Cola bottle?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the age of your old RC Cola bottle involves examining several key characteristics. Look closely for embossed or applied color labels (ACLs). Embossed bottles are generally older, often pre-1950s. ACLs, while visually appealing, were introduced later. Check the bottle's base for date codes, which are often stamped or embossed. These codes can be complex, but typically include a year, sometimes with a month or week identifier. Refer to online resources and collector guides that decipher these codes for specific RC Cola bottles.\n\n*   **Embossing:** Indicates older bottles, often pre-1950s.\n*   **ACL (Applied Color Label):** Generally indicates a more recent bottle.\n*   **Base Codes:** Look for date codes on the base of the bottle.

What factors influence the value of an old RC Cola bottle?**\n\n**Answer:** The value of an old RC Cola bottle is determined by a combination of factors, including rarity, condition, age, and historical significance.
