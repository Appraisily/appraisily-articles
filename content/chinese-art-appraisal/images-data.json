The scene is set on a polished dark wood table, strewn with appraisal tools like calipers, soft brushes, and reference books with Chinese characters. Soft, focused overhead lighting illuminates the jade piece and the appraiser's hands (wearing white cotton gloves), creating subtle shadows and highlighting the texture of the jade and the aged paper of the books.
