  "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user with their in-depth research on \"antique glass value.\" Let me start by understanding each part of their query. They want a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each of the search results provided to find relevant information. The user mentioned they want detailed sections with examples and data, so I need to extract key points from the sources. \n\nFor the first section, defining antique glass value and its importance. From source [4], it talks about factors like age, maker, rarity, and condition affecting value. Also, source [10] mentions rarity, age, size, and condition as factors. Importance might tie into historical significance and craftsmanship, which sources [2] and [3] touch on regarding the history and types of glass.\n\nNext, historical background. Source [2] gives a good overview of glass-making history, starting from Mesopotamia and Egypt. Source [3] discusses different historical glass types like Murano and Lalique, which can be examples. Source [6] mentions current trends but also references historical periods like Georgian and Depression-era glass.\n\nTypes or categories: Source [3] lists types like Art Nouveau, Art Deco, cameo, and cut glass. Source [11] talks about Murano glass characteristics. Source [10] differentiates cut glass patterns. I should categorize these and maybe include examples like Depression glass from source [1].\n\nFactors determining value: Sources [1], [4], [5], and [10] all discuss factors like markings (pontil, mold lines), maker's marks, age, rarity, condition, and craftsmanship. Source [4] also mentions provenance and market demand. Need to compile these into a list with examples, maybe using the pontil mark from [1] as a case study.\n\nIdentifying authentic pieces: Sources [1], [5], [11] provide tips. Pontil marks, mold lines, bubbles, and markings are key. Murano glass has specific traits like air bubbles and pontil marks [11]. Source [5] suggests checking patina and color. Also, documentation and provenance from [14] can be included.\n\nMarket trends: Source [6] and [12] discuss current trends. Venetian, Georgian, Depression-era, and Art Deco glass are in demand. Mid-century modern and sustainable collecting are trends in [12]. Pricing examples from [10], like the Trellis pattern worth $14k-$15k, and source [1] mentions pink Depression glass prices.\n\nWhere to buy/sell: Source [7] mentions TradeWheel.com, and [9] is about the Houston Glass Show. Auctions, antique shops, online platforms like Etsy/Chairish from [6]. Also, specialized dealers as in [9].\n\nCare and maintenance: Source [8] has detailed steps—gentle washing, avoiding dishwashers, using distilled water, removing stains with vinegar. Also, handling and storage tips. Source [13] talks about restoration glass, but maybe less relevant here.\n\nI need to structure all this into the eight sections, using headers, lists, and examples. Make sure each section cites the relevant sources. For instance, when discussing factors, cite [4] and [10]. When talking about Murano glass, cite [11]. Current trends would use [6] and [12]. Care tips from [8]. \n\nCheck for any conflicting information. For example, source [1] says pontil marks indicate hand-blown and higher value, which aligns with [11] on Murano. Also, ensure that each part of the query is addressed thoroughly. Maybe include a table comparing glass types or factors affecting value for clarity. \n\nAvoid using markdown since the user wants it in the answer, but in the thinking process, just outline. Make sure examples are specific, like Depression glass prices from [1], Trellis cut glass from [10], and the Houston event in [9]. \n\nNeed to verify dates for current trends—source [6] is from 2024 and [12] covers 2024-2025, which is relevant as the current date is March 2025. \n\nFinally, ensure the answer is comprehensive, covers all eight points, uses multiple sources for each section, and cites them properly. Organize sections logically, starting from definition to care tips. Use subheadings, bullet points, and maybe a table for factors or types if it enhances readability.\n</think>\n\nAntique glass encompasses centuries of craftsmanship and design evolution, with value determined by historical significance, artistry, and market dynamics. This guide synthesizes key aspects of valuation, identification, and market trends for collectors and researchers.\n\n## 1. Defining Antique Glass Value  \nAntique glass value represents the monetary and cultural worth of handcrafted or early machine-made glass objects (pre-1950s). Its importance stems from:  \n- **Historical preservation**: Many pieces document technological advancements like the transition from hand-blown (pre-1880s) to mold-made production[1][2]  \n- **Artistic merit**: Exceptional examples include Tiffany Studios' Favrile glass ($15,000-$50,000 for lamps) and Lalique's Art Deco vases ($8,000-$25,000)[3][12]  \n- **Material science**: Early formulations like Egyptian cobalt blue glass (2100 BCE) show ancient technological innovation[2]  \n\n## 2.
