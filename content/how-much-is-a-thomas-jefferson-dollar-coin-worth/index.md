Okay, I need to write a comprehensive article on the value of the Thomas Jefferson dollar coin. Let me start by understanding the user's query. They want detailed information covering eight specific aspects, from historical background to market trends. 

First, I'll check the search results provided. There are 13 sources, some from coin dealers, collectors, and informational sites. The key points from the sources mention that most Thomas Jefferson dollar coins are worth face value unless they're uncirculated, proofs, or have errors. The 2007 coins from Philadelphia and Denver mints have high mintage, so they're common. The San Francisco mint produced proofs which are more valuable. Errors like missing edge lettering or die clashes can increase the value significantly. There's also a 1993 commemorative silver dollar mentioned, which might be a separate piece.

The user's first point is about what the coin is and why it's important. I should explain it's part of the Presidential Dollar series, introduced in 2007, honoring Jefferson as the third president. Its importance comes from historical significance and collectibility, especially errors or rare mintings.

For historical background, I need to mention the Presidential Dollar Program's inception, Jefferson's role in U.S. history, and maybe touch on his contributions to coinage systems, as one source mentioned his involvement in decimal coinage.

Different types would include the regular 2007 P and D coins, the S proofs, and error coins like missing edge lettering or doubled dies. The 1993 commemorative is another type but might be a separate section.

Factors affecting value: mintage numbers, condition (grading), errors, and metal content (like the 1993 silver dollar). Also, historical context, like the 2007 edge lettering errors.

Identifying authentic coins: looking for mint marks on the edge, checking for errors, and verifying through grading services. Mention the edge inscriptions and design details.

Market trends: While most are common, high-grade or error coins are sought after. The 1993 silver dollar has a different market as a commemorative. Recent interest in Jefferson nickels (from source 6) might not be directly relevant but shows collector trends.

Where to buy/sell: coin dealers, online marketplaces, auctions. Mention places like PCGS, APMEX, Heritage Auctions.

Care and preservation: handling with gloves, using holders, avoiding cleaning.

I need to structure all this into sections, using the provided search results as citations. Make sure each section flows into the next, avoiding lists and using paragraphs. Cite sources inline, like [1], [3], [4], etc. 

Check for any missing points. For example, the 1993 commemorative is a different coin but part of Jefferson's numismatic history. Also, Jefferson's own coin collection influencing U.S. coinage (source 12) adds historical depth.

Ensure each section has enough detail, examples, and data points. For instance, in the value factors, mention mintage numbers from source 3 (100 million for P, 102 million for D), and the 1993 S proof mintage. Error coins like missing edge lettering from source 2 and 4 can be case studies.

Avoid using lists, so convert bullet points into prose. For example, instead of listing error types, describe them in sentences with examples.

Make sure the conclusion synthesizes the findings, perhaps noting that while most Jefferson dollars are common, specific varieties and errors hold significant value, reflecting broader numismatic trends.

# The Comprehensive Guide to the Value of Thomas Jefferson Dollar Coins  

The Thomas Jefferson dollar coin, part of the U.S. Presidential Dollar series, represents a fusion of historical commemoration and numismatic intrigue. While most examples circulate at face value, certain variants—such as uncirculated specimens, proof editions, and error coins—command premiums among collectors. This guide explores the multifaceted factors influencing the coin’s value, its historical context, and its role in modern numismatics.

## Historical Background and Development  

### Origins of the Presidential Dollar Program  
The Thomas Jefferson dollar coin was minted in 2007 as part of the Presidential Dollar Program, a congressional initiative launched to honor U.S. presidents in the order of their service[1][8]. Jefferson’s coin followed those of George Washington and John Adams, reflecting his tenure as the nation’s third president (1801–1809)[1][8]. The program aimed to revitalize public interest in dollar coins while celebrating presidential legacies.  

### Jefferson’s Numismatic Legacy  
Beyond his presidency, Jefferson played a pivotal role in shaping America’s decimal coinage system. His advocacy for a standardized monetary framework, detailed in his 1784 *Notes on Coinage*, laid the groundwork for the dollar’s divisibility into cents and mills[12]. This intellectual contribution underscores the historical weight of his commemorative coinage.

## Types and Variations of Thomas Jefferson Dollar Coins  

### Standard Circulation Coins (2007-P and 2007-D)  
- **2007-P (Philadelphia Mint)**: Struck in Philadelphia, these coins lack a mint mark and have a mintage of 100.8 million[3][5].  
- **2007-D (Denver Mint)**: Bearing a “D” mint mark on the edge, 102.81 million were produced[3][5].  
Both types typically circulate at face value ($1) but may fetch $3–$5 in uncirculated condition (MS-65 grade)[3][8].  

### Proof Coins (2007-S)  
The San Francisco Mint struck 3.97 million proof versions, characterized by sharper details and a mirrored finish. These coins, marked with an “S” on the edge, are valued at $4–$10 in PR-65 condition[3][5].  

### Commemorative Issues: The 1993 Silver Dollar  
A separate 1993 commemorative silver dollar honored Jefferson’s 250th birthday. Composed of 90% silver, it features Monticello on the reverse and has a mintage of 600,000. Proof versions (1993-S) sell for $30–$50, while uncirculated examples (1993-P) range from $25–$40[7][10].  

### Error Coins and Varieties  
- **Missing Edge Lettering**: A 2007 error omitting “In God We Trust” or “E Pluribus Unum” from the edge. Only 1,300 examples are certified, with values reaching $1,725 at auction[2][4].  
- **Doubled Dies and Clashed Dies**: Misaligned strikes creating duplicated design elements. These errors can elevate values to $50–$100[13].  
- **Positional Varieties**: Edge lettering oriented toward the obverse (Position A) or reverse (Position B), though these typically don’t affect value[9].

## Factors Determining Value  

### Mintage and Rarity  
High mintage figures for 2007-P and 2007-D coins limit their rarity, whereas proof and error coins benefit from lower production numbers. The 1993 silver dollar’s capped mintage enhances its collectibility[3][7][10].  

### Condition and Grading  
Coins are graded on the Sheldon Scale (1–70). Circulated examples grade below MS-60 and retain face value, while MS-65 specimens (no visible wear) may reach $5–$16[3][5]. Proofs graded PR-70 (flawless) can exceed $50[5].  

### Historical and Material Composition  
The 1993 silver dollar’s 0.7736 oz silver content ties its value to precious metal markets[7][10]. Wartime nickels (1942–1945) with 35% silver, though unrelated to Jefferson dollars, illustrate how metal content influences numismatic appeal[6].

## Identifying Authentic and High-Quality Specimens  

### Key Design Features  
- **Obverse**: Joseph Menna’s portrait of Jefferson, inscribed “3rd President” and “1801–1809”[1][9].  
- **Reverse**: Don Everhart’s Statue of Liberty design with “United States of America” and “$1”[1][9].  
- **Edge Lettering**: Includes the mint mark, year, and national mottos. Errors here are highly sought[2][8].  

### Authentication Tips  
- Use magnification to detect doubling or clashing.  
- Verify edge inscriptions for completeness and orientation[2][9].  
- Consult grading services like PCGS or NGC for certification[2][5].

## Current Market Trends and Pricing  

### Circulating Coins  
Most 2007-P and 2007-D coins remain in circulation, valued at $1. Uncirculated rolls (25 coins) sell for $25–$40, appealing to bulk collectors[11].  

### Error Coins  
Missing-edge-lettering errors dominate the premium market, with PCGS-graded MS-66 examples selling for $500–$1,725[2][4].  

### Commemorative Silver Dollars  
The 1993 issue has stabilized at $25–$50, though high-grade proofs (PR-70) occasionally reach $100+[7][10].

## Acquisition and Sale Channels  

### Buying Platforms  
- **Online Retailers**: APMEX, Littleton Coin, and Golden Eagle Coin offer raw and graded specimens[7][11][12].  
- **Auctions**: Heritage Auctions and eBay feature rare errors and proofs[2][13].  

### Selling Strategies  
- Submit high-grade or error coins to PCGS/NGC for encapsulation, boosting resale value[2][5].  
- Target niche collectors via numismatic forums or social media groups.  

---

## Preservation and Care  

### Storage Best Practices  
- Use acid-free flips or slabs to prevent oxidation.  
- Avoid handling coins with bare hands; oils accelerate tarnishing[3][7].  

### Cleaning Warnings  
Never clean coins with abrasive materials. Improper cleaning can devalue specimens by 50% or more[3][13].

## Conclusion  

The Thomas Jefferson dollar coin embodies a bridge between historical reverence and collector enthusiasm. While most examples hold minimal monetary value, anomalies like edge-lettering errors or pristine proofs underscore the dynamic interplay of rarity, condition, and market demand. For historians and numismatists alike, these coins offer a tangible connection to Jefferson’s enduring legacy—both as a statesman and a architect of American currency.  

As the market for presidential coins evolves, Jefferson’s numismatic tributes remain a testament to the nuanced artistry and historical storytelling embedded in U.S. minting traditions. Collectors are advised to prioritize authentication and preservation to capitalize on emerging opportunities in this niche yet vibrant sector.
