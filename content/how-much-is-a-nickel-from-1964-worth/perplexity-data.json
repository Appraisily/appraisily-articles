  "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a comprehensive article about the value of a 1964 nickel. Let me start by understanding the user's query. They want detailed information covering eight specific aspects. Let me break down each part.\n\nFirst, I need to explain what a 1964 nickel is worth and why it's important. From the search results, I see that most are common and worth face value, but some rare ones can be valuable. The historical context is crucial here, like the coin shortage in 1964 leading to high mintage. I should mention the Philadelphia and Denver mints, their mintages, and the date freeze causing production into 1965 and 1966.\n\nNext, the historical background. The Jefferson nickel started in 1938, designed by Felix Schlag. During WWII, they used silver, but by 1964, they were back to copper-nickel. The 1964 nickels are significant because they were the last before the composition change, but wait, no—the search results say 1964 wasn't a silver year. I need to clarify that. The coin shortage led to massive production, making them common but some varieties valuable.\n\nDifferent types and variations: The main ones are Philadelphia (no mint mark) and Denver (D). Also, proof coins, special mint sets, and errors like doubled dies or off-center strikes. Full Steps designation is important, where the steps on Monticello are fully visible. The Specimen coins from 1964 are extremely rare.\n\nFactors determining value: Condition (graded from circulated to Mint State), mint mark, presence of Full Steps, and errors. High grades like MS67 can fetch high prices. Errors can significantly increase value. The 1964-D with Full Steps in high grades is valuable.\n\nIdentifying authentic coins: Look for mint marks, check steps on Monticello, and verify errors through professional grading. NGC and PCGS certifications are mentioned as important for authentication.\n\nMarket trends: Prices range from face value to thousands for high-grade or error coins. Recent auction results, like the $14,100 sale in 2017 for a Full Steps MS67. The SMS specimens can be very valuable, up to $32,900.\n\nWhere to buy/sell: Auctions, dealers, online platforms like eBay. Mention reputable grading services and the importance of certification.\n\nCare and preservation: Use protective holders, avoid handling, control environment. Sources like the Royal Canadian Mint and Universal Coin & Bullion suggest archival storage and avoiding PVC.\n\nI need to structure all this into sections with headers, avoiding lists. Use citations from the search results. For example, the NGC Price Guide values, the PCGS auction records, and the error examples from Heritage Auctions.\n\nMake sure each section flows into the next, providing detailed paragraphs with examples. Check that all eight aspects from the query are covered. Verify facts against the provided sources to ensure accuracy. Avoid any markdown except headers and citations. Keep the tone academic but accessible, citing sources inline with brackets.\n</think>\n\n# The Comprehensive Guide to the Value and Significance of the 1964 Jefferson Nickel  \n\nThe 1964 Jefferson Nickel occupies a unique position in American numismatic history, marked by its massive mintage during a national coin shortage and its subsequent variations that command significant collector interest. While most 1964 nickels remain common and valued at face value, specific grades, mint marks, and errors can elevate their worth to thousands of dollars. This report synthesizes historical context, grading criteria, market dynamics, and preservation strategies to provide a detailed analysis of this iconic coin.  \n\n---\n\n## Historical Background and Development of the 1964 Jefferson Nickel  \n\nThe 1964 Jefferson Nickel emerged during a period of economic and numismatic transition. Following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, the U.S. Mint faced unprecedented demand for circulating coinage, exacerbated by hoarding during the mid-1960s coin shortage[6]. Congress authorized a \"date freeze\" in September 1964, permitting the continued production of 1964-dated nickels into 1965 and 1966 to deter speculation[1][6]. This resulted in record-breaking mintages: **1.02 billion** from Philadelphia (no mintmark) and **1.79 billion** from Denver (\"D\" mintmark)[1][4].  \n\nDesigned by Felix Schlag in 1938, the Jefferson Nickel replaced the Buffalo Nickel and retained its original composition of **75% copper and 25% nickel**[3][12]. Unlike wartime \"silver nickels\" (1942–1945), the 1964 issue contains no precious metals, deriving value solely from numismatic factors[12]. The coin’s obverse features a left-facing portrait of Thomas Jefferson, while the reverse depicts his Monticello estate, with the steps of the building becoming a critical grading element[1][3].  \n\n---\n\n## Types and Variations of 1964 Nickels  \n\n### 1. **Philadelphia (No Mintmark) vs. Denver (\"D\") Issues**  \n- **Philadelphia**: Struck without a mintmark, these accounted for 1.02 billion units. Circulated examples typically trade for $0.05–$0.10, while uncirculated (MS-65) specimens range from $15 to $500[1][4].  \n- **Denver**: Identified by the \"D\" mintmark to the right of Monticello, the 1.79 billion 1964-D nickels are marginally scarcer in high grades. A 1964-D graded MS-67 with Full Steps (FS) sold for $4,250 in 2021[4][8].  \n\n### 2. **Proof and Special Strikes**  \n- **Proof Coins**: Approximately 3.2 million proof nickels were struck in Philadelphia, characterized by mirror-like fields and frosted designs. These trade for $2–$215 in PR-69 condition[9][11].  \n- **Special Mint Set (SMS) Coins**: A limited number of 1964 SMS nickels, struck with polished dies, have surfaced since the 1990s. One SMS SP-68 example fetched $31,200 in 2021[8].  \n\n### 3. **Error Coins**  \n- **Full Steps (FS) Varieties**: Coins displaying five or six fully defined steps on Monticello’s facade are highly prized. A 1964 FS MS-67 sold for $14,100 in 2017[4][8].  \n- **Striking Errors**: Notable errors include double dies, off-center strikes, and brockages. A 1964 nickel struck on a 10-centavo planchet realized $9,700 at auction[3][7].  \n\n---\n\n## Factors Determining Value and Quality  \n\n### 1. **Grading and Condition**  \nThe Sheldon Scale (1–70) determines a nickel’s marketability:  \n- **Circulated (G-4 to EF-45)**: Worth $0.05–$0.20, with heavy wear on Jefferson’s cheek and Monticello’s steps[2][5].  \n- **Uncirculated (MS-60 to MS-70)**: Values escalate sharply, with MS-65 examples trading for $15–$600 and MS-67 specimens reaching $4,250–$15,000[1][4][8].  \n- **Proofs (PR-60 to PR-70)**: Deep Cameo proofs in PR-69 grade command $215–$1,000[9][11].  \n\n### 2. **Mintmark Rarity**  \nWhile both Philadelphia and Denver issues are abundant, high-grade Denver nickels (e.g., MS-67) are 30% scarcer than their Philadelphia counterparts, justifying premiums of 20–50%[4][8].  \n\n### 3. **Full Steps Designation**  \nCoins earning the FS label from NGC or PCGS often sell for 10–100x their non-FS equivalents. A 1964 MS-67 FS holds a record $14,100, whereas a non-FS MS-67 trades for $500[1][4].  \n\n### 4. **Error Significance**  \n- **Double Dies**: A 1964 D/D repunched mintmark graded MS-65 sold for $6,000 in 2021[8].  \n- **Off-Center Strikes**: 10–15% off-center errors fetch $50–$200, while 50% misalignments command $500–$1,000[3][7].  \n\n---\n\n## Identifying Authentic and High-Quality Specimens  \n\n### 1. **Visual Inspection**  \n- **Full Steps**: Use a 5x loupe to verify five or six fully separated steps beneath Monticello’s portico[1][3].  \n- **Mint Luster**: Uncirculated coins exhibit original cartwheel luster, absent on cleaned or worn examples[2][5].  \n- **Error Authentication**: Cross-reference suspected errors with PCGS CoinFacts or NGC Cert Verification tools[3][7].  \n\n### 2. **Professional Certification**  \nCoins graded by NGC or PCGS carry tamper-evident holders and population reports. For example, only **12** 1964-D nickels have been graded MS-67 FS by NGC, ensuring market liquidity[1][8].  \n\n---\n\n## Current Market Trends and Pricing  \n\n### 1. **Auction Highlights (2021–2024)**  \n- **1964 SMS SP-68 FS**: $32,900 (Heritage Auctions, 2021)[8].  \n- **1964-D MS-67 FS**: $4,250 (PCGS, 2021)[4].  \n- **1964 Proof PR-69 DCAM**: $215 (eBay, 2023)[10].  \n\n### 2. **Price Guides (2025)**  \n- **Circulated**: $0.05–$0.20[2][5].  \n- **MS-63**: $0.46–$1.50[2][4].  \n- **MS-65**: $15–$85[4][8].  \n- **MS-67+ FS**: $4,250–$15,000[1][8].  \n\n---\n\n## Acquisition and Sales Channels  \n\n### 1. **Reputable Dealers**  \nFirms like Heritage Auctions and PCGS-authorised dealers offer certified coins, with premiums of 10–20% over raw examples[8][11].  \n\n### 2. **Online Platforms**  \n- **eBay**: Listings range from $0.10 (circulated) to $12,000 (MS-67 FS)[10].  \n- **Coin Shows**: Annual events like the ANA National Money Show provide access to rare errors and proofs[3][7].  \n\n### 3. **Grading Submissions**  \nSubmit potential high-value nickels to NGC or PCGS for encapsulation, costing $30–$100 per coin depending on tiered services[1][8].  \n\n---\n\n## Preservation and Care Strategies  \n\n### 1. **Storage Solutions**  \n- **Archival Holders**: Use NGC-approved flips or slabs to prevent PVC damage[13][14].  \n- **Climate Control**: Maintain 40–50% humidity and 65–70°F to avoid toning or corrosion[13][14].  \n\n### 2. **Handling Protocols**  \n- **Cotton Gloves**: Prevent fingerprint oils from etching surfaces[13][14].  \n- **Avoid Cleaning**: Harsh chemicals or abrasives reduce value by 50–90%[2][5].  \n\n---\n\n## Conclusion  \n\nThe 1964 Jefferson Nickel’s value hinges on a confluence of historical context, minting nuances, and collector demand. While most specimens remain everyday pocket change, exceptional examples—whether high-grade, error-struck, or proof—embody the intersection of numismatic artistry and economic history. For collectors, meticulous research, third-party grading, and prudent preservation are indispensable to navigating this dynamic market.",
