Okay, let's tackle this query about antique furniture appraisal. The user wants a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects. First, I need to go through each of the search results provided to gather relevant information.

Starting with the first aspect: What is antique furniture appraisal and why is it important? From search result [1], it mentions that an appraisal assesses age, value, condition, and authenticity. It's performed by a qualified appraiser. The importance includes insurance, taxes, estate planning, and fair sales. Search result [10] also adds that appraisals help in estate sales, insurance values, and tax deductions. So, combining these, the introduction should define appraisal and list its purposes.

Next, historical background. The search results don't explicitly mention the history of appraisal practices. However, result [5] talks about trends in 2025, like digital platforms and technology integration. Maybe the historical part isn't covered in the sources, so I might need to note that or infer from the evolution mentioned in [5] about how methods have changed over time.

Types of appraisals: Search result [2] from Prestige Estate Services lists different types like antique, vintage, contemporary, and high-end furniture appraisals. Result [6] mentions online vs. onsite appraisals, and result [8] differentiates between verbal and written appraisals. Also, [12] and [8] discuss appraisal vs. valuation. So, the types would include categories based on furniture era, purpose (insurance, legal), and method (verbal/written, online/onsite).

Factors determining value: Search result [3] lists age, rarity, cultural value, material, historical relation, and condition. Result [11] adds provenance, craftsmanship, and market trends. Result [13] mentions age, condition, provenance, historical importance, and market demand. So, factors are age, rarity, condition, provenance, materials, craftsmanship, and market trends.

Identifying authentic appraisals: Search result [17] emphasizes certified appraisers from organizations like ISA or AAA. Result [6] mentions USPAP compliance. So, checking credentials, certifications, and adherence to standards like USPAP are key. Also, detailed reports with photos and research, as per [10] and [13].

Current market trends: Result [5] highlights digital platforms, online appraisals, and tech like data analytics. Also, mentions trends in 2025 like virtual consultations and integration of advanced tools. Result [14] talks about comparing auction sales and online databases. So, trends include digitalization, online services, and tech-driven valuations.

Where to find/buy/sell: Search result [17] lists local certified appraisers and online services. Result [6] offers online appraisals starting at $25. Auction houses, estate sales, and specialized firms like Prestige or ECR Antique Conservation are mentioned in [2], [15], and [17].

Care and maintenance: Results [7], [16], and [18] provide tips. Regular dusting, avoiding moisture, controlling humidity, using mild cleaners, and professional restoration. Also, avoiding silicone and tung oil as per [7]. Immediate spill management and proper storage are from [16] and [18].

I need to structure all this into sections, using headers, and cite the sources appropriately. Make sure each section addresses the query points, using the most relevant sources. For example, when discussing factors, cite [3], [11], [13]. For care tips, cite [7], [16], [18]. Also, check if any examples or case studies are mentioned in the sources. It seems there aren't specific case studies, but maybe mention examples like insurance appraisals or estate sales as use cases.

Ensure that each section is concise but comprehensive, using bullet points or tables where appropriate. Since the user wants a guide, the structure should be clear and easy to follow. Avoid markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer should follow the format rules with headers, citations, etc.
