  "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to tackle this query about the value of a 1982-D penny. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want a comprehensive article covering several aspects: the worth, historical background, variations, factors affecting value, authentication, market trends, buying/selling tips, and preservation. \n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. The user included 13 sources, mostly from coin websites and YouTube videos. Let me go through each to extract relevant info. \n\nFrom [1], JM Bullion mentions the 1982-D Small Date copper penny being rare, with values up to $18,800. They explain the transition from copper to zinc in 1982. [2] is a YouTube video that talks about specific errors and their values, like double dies and misaligned strikes. It also mentions the weight difference (3.1g vs. 2.5g) as a key identifier. \n\nSource [3] from Coin Identifier gives a breakdown of compositions and design elements, including the Small Date vs. Large Date. [4] from Bullion Shark provides metal content details and values for different conditions. [5] from Coinappraiser.com notes that the Large Date is common, but high grades or errors can increase value. \n\n[6] from Coin Identifier again emphasizes the transition year and the varieties created. It has a table with different varieties, compositions, and weights. [7] from Coin Value Checker offers a value chart based on mint marks and conditions, which is useful for section 4 (factors determining value). \n\n[8] from APMEX explains how to identify Small vs. Large Dates by the shape of the numbers, especially the '8' and '2'. [9] from Bryan County United Way gives historical context about the 1982 transition and the rarity of the D Small Date copper penny. [10] from Bullion Shark again discusses metal content and storage tips. \n\n[11] from The Fun Times Guide highlights the two known 1982-D Small Date copper pennies found in circulation. [12] from Accurate PMR talks about grading and the significance of the 1982 transition. [13] is another YouTube video reinforcing the rarity and auction prices.\n\nNow, structuring the answer according to the user's requested sections. \n\n1. **Introduction and Importance**: Start by explaining why the 1982-D penny is significant, mainly due to the composition change and the rare Small Date copper variant. Cite sources [1], [6], [8], [9].\n\n2. **Historical Background**: Discuss the 1982 transition from copper to zinc, the reasons (rising copper prices), and the introduction of Small/Large Dates. Sources [1], [3], [6], [8], [9], [10].\n\n3. **Types and Variations**: Break down into Large Date vs. Small Date, copper vs. zinc, mint marks (D vs. no mark). Use tables from [6], [7], [3].\n\n4. **Factors Affecting Value**: Composition (copper more valuable), date size (Small Date rarer), condition/grading, errors (double dies, etc.). Sources [1], [2], [4], [7], [8], [11].\n\n5. **Identification Tips**: Weight (3.1g vs. 2.5g), visual cues (date style, mint mark), use of scales/magnification.

In Factors, discuss weight and date size using [1][6][8]. \n\nAlso, check for conflicting info. For instance, some sources mention only two known D Small Date coppers [1][11], while others might not. Ensure consistency. \n\nMake sure to cite each relevant point with the source indices. Avoid using markdown, just plain text with citations in brackets. Keep the tone academic but accessible, avoiding jargon where possible. \n\nFinally, verify that all user questions are addressed in the sections. The user asked for 8 specific aspects, so each should have a dedicated section with subsections as needed. Use examples like the $18,800 auction sale from [1][11] and the grading scales from [7][12].\n</think>\n\n# Comprehensive Analysis of the 1982-D Penny: Value, Varieties, and Market Dynamics  \n\nThe 1982-D penny represents a pivotal moment in U.S. coinage history, marked by a transition in composition and design that has created rare and valuable collectibles. This guide explores the nuances of this coin, offering insights into its historical significance, varieties, valuation factors, and preservation strategies.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction to the 1982-D Penny and Its Significance  \nThe 1982-D Lincoln cent is notable for two key reasons:  \n- **Composition Shift**: In 1982, the U.S. Mint transitioned from a 95% copper alloy to a zinc core with a copper plating to reduce production costs[1][6][9]. This created two distinct penny types: **copper** (3.11 grams) and **zinc** (2.5 grams).  \n- **Rarity of Errors**: A small number of 1982-D pennies were struck on leftover copper planchets using the new \"Small Date\" dies, resulting in ultra-rare transitional errors. Only two confirmed 1982-D Small Date copper pennies exist, with one selling for $18,800 in 2017[1][11][13].  \n\nThese factors make the 1982-D penny a focal point for numismatists and investors alike.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Historical Context and Development  \n### The 1982 Transition  \n- **Economic Drivers**: Rising copper prices in the late 1970s prompted the Mint to seek cheaper alternatives. By 1982, the cost of producing a copper penny exceeded its face value[6][9][12].  \n- **Design Adjustments**: To accommodate the softer zinc planchets, the Mint introduced a \"Small Date\" variant with slimmer numerals and adjusted spacing[8][12]. This design was intended to reduce die wear but inadvertently created collectible varieties.  \n\n### Denver Mint’s Role  \nThe Denver Mint (denoted by the \"D\" mintmark) produced both **Large Date** and **Small Date** pennies in 1982. While most were zinc, a handful of copper planchets from earlier production were mistakenly used, creating the legendary 1982-D Small Date copper error[1][9][11].  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Types and Variations of the 1982-D Penny  \n### Key Varieties  \n| Variety               | Composition | Weight  | Mintmark | Rarity          |  \n|-----------------------|-------------|---------|----------|-----------------|  \n| Large Date Copper     | 95% Cu      | 3.11g   | D        | Common          |  \n| Small Date Zinc       | 97.5% Zn    | 2.5g    | D        | Common          |  \n| **Small Date Copper** | 95% Cu      | 3.11g   | D        | Extremely Rare  |  \n\n- **Large Date vs. Small Date**:  \n  - **Large Date**: Bold numerals; the \"2\" in \"1982\" has a straight tail[6][8].  \n  - **Small Date**: Slimmer numerals; the \"2\" curves slightly at the base[8][12].  \n\n### Error Coins  \n- **Double Die Obverse**: Doubling visible on \"IN GOD WE TRUST\" or the date[2][7].  \n- **Off-Center Strikes**: Misaligned dies creating partial designs[2][10].  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Factors Determining Value  \n### Primary Valuation Criteria  \n1. **Composition**: Copper pennies command higher premiums due to metal content and rarity[1][6][10].  \n2. **Date Variety**: Small Date copper pennies are the most valuable, with auction records exceeding $10,000[1][11][13].  \n3. **Condition (Grade)**:  \n   - Circulated (Good–Extremely Fine): $0.05–$5[7][10].  \n   - Uncirculated (MS-60–MS-70): $10–$250+[7][12].  \n4. **Errors**: Double dies or misstrikes can increase value by 100–1,000x[2][7].  \n\n### Case Study: The 1982-D Small Date Copper  \n- **Discovery**: First identified in 2016, this error coin weighs 3.11g and features the Small Date design[1][11].  \n- **Auction Performance**: Graded AU-58, it sold for $18,800 in 2017[1][13].  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Authenticity and Identification  \n### Step-by-Step Authentication  \n1. **Weight Test**: Use a precision scale. Copper pennies weigh 3.11g; zinc pennies weigh 2.5g[1][6][11].  \n2. **Visual Inspection**:  \n   - **Date Style**: Compare the \"2\" in \"1982\" to reference images[8][12].  \n   - **Mintmark Placement**: The \"D\" should be centered below the date[9][11].  \n3. **Magnet Test**: Zinc pennies are slightly magnetic due to their steel core; copper pennies are not[10].  \n\n### Tools for Collectors  \n- Digital scales (accuracy ±0.01g).  \n- Magnifying loupes (10x magnification) to detect doubling or wear.  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Market Trends and Pricing  \n### Current Valuations (2024)  \n| Variety               | Circulated | Uncirculated (MS-65) |  \n|-----------------------|------------|----------------------|  \n| Large Date Zinc       | $0.01      | $0.50–$2             |  \n| Large Date Copper     | $1–$3      | $15–$50              |  \n| Small Date Zinc       | $0.01      | $5–$10               |  \n| **Small Date Copper** | N/A        | $10,000–$20,000+     |  \n\n### Auction Highlights  \n- A 1982-D Small Date copper penny graded MS-65 sold for $10,800 in 2019[11][13].  \n- Double die obverse errors fetch $150–$500 in circulated grades[2][7].  \n\n---\n\n## 7. Acquisition and Sale Channels  \n### Where to Buy/Sell  \n- **Auction Houses**: Heritage Auctions, Stack’s Bowers (for high-value errors)[11][13].  \n- **Coin Dealers**: Specialized numismatic shops offer authentication services[5][7].  \n- **Online Platforms**: eBay, PCGS CoinFacts, and NGC Collectors Society[10][12].  \n\n### Authentication Services  \n- **PCGS** and **NGC**: Provide grading and encapsulation, critical for high-value coins[12][13].  \n\n---\n\n## 8. Preservation and Care  \n### Best Practices  \n- **Storage**: Use inert Mylar flips or archival-quality holders to prevent oxidation[10][12].  \n- **Handling**: Wear cotton gloves to avoid transferring oils to the surface.  \n- **Environment**: Store in a climate-controlled space (50–60% humidity, 65–70°F)[10].  \n\n### Risks to Avoid  \n- Cleaning: Abrasive methods (e.g., polishing) reduce value by damaging surfaces[10][12].  \n- Exposure to PVC: Plastic holders containing PVC can cause green corrosion over time[12].  \n\n---\n\n## Conclusion  \nThe 1982-D penny encapsulates a critical juncture in U.S. monetary history, blending economic pragmatism with numismatic intrigue. While most examples are worth face value, the rare Small Date copper variant exemplifies how transitional errors can yield extraordinary value. Collectors are advised to methodically inspect their holdings, leveraging weight tests and grading services to uncover potential treasures. As the market for error coins grows, the 1982-D penny remains a compelling study in rarity, historical context, and investment potential.",
