  "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on the value of Mengel furniture. Let me start by breaking down the user's query into the eight specified sections. \n\nFirst, I should define what Mengel furniture is and why it's valuable. From the search results, Mengel is known for mid-century modern designs, especially those by Raymond Loewy. Their pieces are valued for craftsmanship and design. I'll mention the price range found in source [1], which is $500 to $13,500.\n\nNext, the historical background. Mengel started in 1877, making barrels and boxes, then expanded into furniture. Post-WWII, they collaborated with Loewy, which is a key point from sources [6] and [7]. The \"Permanized\" line is important here, as noted in [11].\n\nFor types and variations, the search results mention casegoods, credenzas, dressers, and dining sets. Raymond Loewy's designs are a major category. I should differentiate between pre-war and mid-century pieces, as seen in [2] and [3].\n\nFactors affecting value include design, condition, materials, and provenance. Authenticity markers like the \"Permanized\" stamp (from [11]) and original hardware (examples in [1] and [4]) are crucial. Market trends show mid-century modern is popular, so Loewy's pieces might be pricier. Recent sales from [4] and [5] can be cited.\n\nIdentifying authentic pieces involves checking stamps, construction quality, and design elements. For example, the cerused oak finishes in [1] and [6].\n\nCurrent market trends: Online platforms like 1stDibs and LiveAuctioneers (sources [1], [4]) are key. Prices vary based on design and condition. The bleached oak dresser in [5] is listed at $1,199.99, but sold items in [4] show a range.\n\nWhere to buy/sell: Mention specialized auctions, antique dealers, and online marketplaces. Care tips from [13] and [14] include avoiding harsh chemicals and controlling humidity. Regular dusting and professional restoration for valuable pieces.\n\nI need to ensure each section flows into the next, using headers properly. Cite sources inline, like [1] for price ranges, [6] for historical collaboration, and [11] for the Permanized line. Avoid lists, use paragraphs, and include examples like specific pieces sold. Check that all eight aspects are covered thoroughly, and the report meets the 10,000-word target by expanding each section with detailed analysis and examples.\n</think>\n\n# The Value and Significance of Mengel Furniture: A Comprehensive Analysis  \n\nMengel Furniture, a name synonymous with mid-century modern design and craftsmanship, has garnered significant attention from collectors and interior designers alike. This report explores the historical, aesthetic, and market factors that define the value of Mengel Furniture, offering a detailed examination of its origins, design philosophy, and contemporary relevance.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding Mengel Furniture and Its Value  \n\nMengel Furniture, produced by the Mengel Company of Louisville, Kentucky, represents a pivotal era in American furniture design. Founded in 1877 as a lumber and barrel manufacturer, the company transitioned into furniture production in the early 20th century, eventually becoming renowned for its mid-century modern pieces. The value of Mengel Furniture lies in its blend of functional design, high-quality materials, and historical significance.  \n\n### Key Factors Driving Value  \n- **Design Legacy**: Collaborations with industrial designer Raymond Loewy (e.g., cerused oak credenzas and convertible dining tables) elevated Mengel’s status[1][6].  \n- **Craftsmanship**: The use of solid woods like mahogany, oak, and walnut, combined with dovetail joints and veneers, ensured durability[2][11].  \n- **Rarity**: Post-1956, Mengel’s acquisition by Kroehler Manufacturing Co. reduced production, making original pieces scarce[11].  \n\nPrices for Mengel Furniture today range from **$500 for simpler dressers** to **$13,500 for rare Loewy-designed casegoods**[1].  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Historical Development of Mengel Furniture  \n\n### Early Beginnings (1877–1940s)  \nMengel began as a lumber supplier, producing whiskey barrels and tobacco boxes. By the 1920s, it expanded into wooden automotive components and toys, leveraging its Belizean timber mills[7][11].  \n\n### Mid-Century Modern Revolution (1950s)  \nThe post-WWII era marked Mengel’s design zenith. Raymond Loewy’s **Permanized** line—characterized by sleek lines and multifunctional pieces like drop-front secretaries—became iconic[6][11]. The term “Permanized” emphasized the furniture’s resistance to warping and veneer separation, a selling point that remains relevant[11].  \n\n### Decline and Legacy (1956–Present)  \nAfter Kroehler’s acquisition, Mengel shifted focus to doors and windows. Surviving furniture pieces are now sought-after collectibles, with Loewy’s designs commanding premium prices[6][11].  \n\n---\n\n## 3.
