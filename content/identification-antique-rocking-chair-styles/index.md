Okay, I need to help the user with their research on identifying antique rocking chair styles. Let me start by understanding each part of their query. They want a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects. 

First, I'll go through each search result to gather relevant information. The user provided 15 sources, so I need to extract data from each that pertains to the eight points. 

1. **What is identification and why it's important?** From the sources, I see that identifying styles helps determine authenticity, age, and value. Sources [1], [4], and [8] mention factors like design, construction, and historical context. It's important for valuation and preservation.

2. **Historical background:** Sources [1], [2], and [3] discuss the origins in the 18th century, mentioning Colonial, Windsor, and Victorian styles. The development from European designs to American adaptations is key here.

3. **Types and variations:** Sources [1], [3], [4], and [12] list styles like Windsor, Shaker, Victorian, Thonet, and Morris. Each has distinct features like spindle backs or bentwood frames.

4. **Factors determining value:** Condition, materials, craftsmanship, and provenance are highlighted in [1], [3], [5], and [8]. Rarity and maker's marks also affect value.

5. **How to identify authentic pieces:** Look for wear, joinery techniques, materials, and maker's marks as per [1], [4], [8], and [14]. Checking for repairs and original parts is crucial.

6. **Market trends and pricing:** Sources [9], [13], and [15] mention growth in the market, with prices ranging from $500 to over $80,000. Sustainability and customization are trends.

7. **Where to buy/sell:** Online platforms like 1stDibs, Chairish, and auctions are noted in [5], [6], [10], [12]. Physical stores and estate sales are also options.

8. **Care and maintenance:** Regular cleaning with appropriate products, avoiding harsh chemicals, and climate control are mentioned in [7], [14], and [12]. Professional restoration is advised.

I need to structure this into sections with headers, using markdown. Each section should include examples and data points. For instance, in historical background, mention the Colonial era, Windsor chairs, and Victorian styles with their features. In market trends, cite the CAGR from [9] and [13].

Make sure to cite sources properly, using brackets after each relevant fact. Avoid listing all sources at the end. Check for any conflicting information, like the origin of rocking chairs (Franklin vs. Thonet in [3]), and present both viewpoints if necessary.

Also, include specific examples like the $80,500 Thonet chair from [3] and the market size projections from [13]. For care tips, mention the cleaning solution from [7] and the use of Penofin oil from [14].

Ensure the answer is comprehensive, covers all eight points, and flows logically. Use subheadings where needed but avoid nested lists. Tables might be useful for comparing styles or factors affecting value. Keep the tone expert and unbiased, citing sources as per the rules.

Antique rocking chairs are cherished for their craftsmanship, historical significance, and aesthetic appeal. Identifying their styles involves analyzing design elements, materials, and historical context to determine authenticity, age, and value. Below is a structured guide to understanding this niche field.

## 1. **What Is Identification of Antique Rocking Chair Styles?**  
Identifying antique rocking chair styles involves analyzing design features, construction techniques, and historical markers to classify chairs into specific periods or maker traditions. This process is critical for:  
- **Valuation**: Authentic styles like Windsor or Thonet command higher prices[1][3].  
- **Preservation**: Understanding a chair’s origins informs proper restoration[4][8].  
- **Historical Context**: Styles reflect cultural trends, such as Shaker minimalism or Victorian ornamentation[1][12].

## 2. **Historical Background**  
Rocking chairs emerged in Europe in the early 18th century, with key developments:  
- **Colonial Era (1710–1800s)**: Early American rockers featured straight lines and Roman-inspired carvings, popularized in Boston[1][2].  
- **Windsor Chairs (18th–19th century)**: Defined by spindle backs and bentwood arms, these became North American staples[1][4].  
- **Victorian Era (Late 1800s)**: Ornate designs with carved arms and curvilinear shapes emerged, valued today at $500–$800[1][3].  
- **Industrial Innovations**: Michael Thonet’s bentwood techniques (1860s) revolutionized mass production[3][4].

| Style              | Key Features                                  | Era/Origin          |  
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|  
| **Windsor**         | Spindle backs, curved seats, splayed legs    | 18th–19th century   |  
| **Shaker**          | Minimalist ladder-backs, woven seats         | Early 1800s         |  
| **Victorian**       | Carved floral patterns, upholstered seats    | Late 1800s          |  
| **Thonet**          | Bentwood frames, cane weaving                | Mid-19th century    |

## 4. **Factors Determining Value**  
- **Materials**: Hardwoods like mahogany or walnut increase value[1][4].

- **Rarity**: Limited-production styles, like Hitchcock models, fetch $2,000+[4][12].

## 5. **Identification Techniques**  
- **Joinery**: Hand-cut dovetails or pegs indicate pre-1900 construction[4][8].  
- **Hardware**: Hand-forged nails (pre-1850) vs. machine-made[4][8].  
- **Patina**: Natural wear on arms/rockers suggests age[8][12].

- **Estate Sales**: Source for unmarked but authentic chairs[12].

## 8. **Care and Maintenance**  
- **Cleaning**: Use 1 Tbsp turpentine + linseed oil in warm water for grime[7].
