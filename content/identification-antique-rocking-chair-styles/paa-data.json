How can I identify the age and style of my antique rocking chair?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying the age and style of an antique rocking chair requires a multi-faceted approach.  First, examine the construction.  Early rocking chairs (pre-1850s) often featured simpler joinery techniques like pegged mortise and tenon joints, while later chairs might utilize screws and glue.  The wood type is crucial;  consider the grain, color, and density.  Popular woods include maple, oak, cherry, and walnut, with variations in availability and popularity over time.  Next, analyze the style.  Look for characteristic features:\n\n* **Shape of the rockers:**  Curved, flat, or S-shaped rockers indicate different periods and styles.\n* **Back design:**  Consider the height, shape (spoon back, ladder back, spindle back), and ornamentation.  Elaborate carving suggests a higher-end piece and specific periods.\n* **Seat construction:**  Is it rush-seated, woven, upholstered, or made of wood?  The material and construction method can be indicative of age and style.\n* **Hardware:**  Examine the type, style, and material of any nails, screws, or decorative hardware.  This can provide clues about the chair's origin and age.\n\nFinally, consult antique furniture guides, online databases (like auction records), and expert appraisers for comparison and verification.  Photographs of similar chairs can be invaluable in narrowing down the age and style.  Remember, thorough documentation including detailed photos is crucial for accurate identification.\n\n**2.
