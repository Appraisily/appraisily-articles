Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive query about "art appraiser near me." Let me start by breaking down each of the eight points the user wants covered. 

First, understanding what an art appraiser near me is. From the search results, it seems they are professionals who evaluate art's value, considering factors like authenticity, market trends, and condition. Their importance lies in accurate valuations for insurance, sales, or estate planning. Local appraisers might have better insight into regional market trends, which is a plus.

Next, historical background. The search results don't explicitly mention the history of art appraisers, but I can infer that the profession evolved with the art market's growth, especially with the need for standardized practices like USPAP. Maybe mention when certification bodies like AAA or ISA were established.

Types of art appraisers: The sources mention different appraisal types like fair market value, replacement value, and historical value. So, categorizing appraisers based on their specialization makes sense here. Also, some might focus on specific art forms or periods.

Determining value factors: The search results list factors like artist reputation, provenance, condition, technique, and market trends. I should elaborate on each, maybe using examples from the sources, like how provenance affected Andy Warhol's cookie jars' value.

Identifying authentic appraisers: Certifications from AAA or ISA are key. Also, checking reviews and local expertise. The sources emphasize certifications and local market knowledge, so highlighting those aspects is important.

Current market trends: The 2025 trends mention digitalization and private sales. Also, the rise of online platforms and cautious buyers. Including stats from the sources, like the 20-30% slowdown in 2024 leading to more private sales in 2025, would be relevant.

Where to find them: Online directories, local galleries, estate services like Prestige Estate, and professional organizations. The steps from source 8 and 12 suggest using online searches and checking credentials.

Care and maintenance: Tips include controlling temperature, humidity, avoiding sunlight, proper framing, and handling. Sources 9, 13, and 16 provide specific guidelines, like 65-75°F and 40-50% humidity. Also, using UV-protective glass and regular dusting.

I need to structure each section with headers, use examples like the Warhol provenance case, and cite sources appropriately. Make sure each section flows logically, covers all points, and integrates the search results effectively without copying verbatim. Also, check that all eight user points are addressed thoroughly with relevant data from the provided sources.
