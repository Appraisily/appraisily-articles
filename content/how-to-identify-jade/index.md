Okay, I need to create a comprehensive guide on how to identify jade. Let's start by breaking down the user's query into the required sections. The user wants eight specific aspects covered, so I'll need to structure the report accordingly.

First, I'll define what jade identification is and why it's important. Jade is valuable both culturally and monetarily, so distinguishing real from fake is crucial. The historical background should cover ancient methods and how they've evolved. I remember sources mentioning Chinese and Mesoamerican uses, so I'll cite those.

Next, types of jade. There's jadeite and nephrite, and various simulants like serpentine or glass. The GIA source [2] talks about jadeite's qualities, and the YouTube video [1] lists simulants. I need to explain each type and how they differ.

Factors affecting value: color, transparency, texture. GIA [2] and Dahlia [6] mention these. Imperial green is top-tier. Also, treatments like dyeing (Grade B, C) affect value. Craftsmanship is another factor from [6].

Identifying authentic jade involves tests like visual inspection, scratch, sound, and feel. The YouTube video [1] and ThePeachBox [7] discuss these. The light test from [7] and professional gemological testing from [1] are important.

Market trends: The PMarketResearch [8] mentions ethical sourcing and personalization. E-commerce and sustainability are trends. Pricing varies by quality; imperial jade can be millions.

Where to buy: Reputable sellers like Mason-Kay [1], Jade West, and events like Monterey Bay Festival [1]. Avoid online marketplaces without certification.

Care and maintenance: Avoid chemicals, clean with mild soap, store separately. Sources [11], [12], [15], [16] provide steps. Oiling with baby oil from [11] and [12] is recommended.

I need to ensure each section flows into the next, using headers properly. Citations should be inline with the sources provided. Make sure to avoid lists and use paragraphs. Also, check that all eight user-requested aspects are covered thoroughly. Let me start drafting each section with the relevant info and citations.

## Historical Evolution of Jade Identification Methods  

### Ancient Authentication Practices  
The earliest jade identification techniques emerged in Neolithic China, where artisans differentiated nephrite from common stones through tactile and visual examination. Shang Dynasty (1600–1046 BCE) craftsmen developed thermal testing methods, recognizing that genuine nephrite remained cool to the touch compared to warmer soapstone imitations[4]. Mesoamerican cultures like the Olmecs (1500–400 BCE) employed hardness tests, using quartz tools to scratch suspected jadeite specimens—a practice later codified in the Mohs scale system[4].  

### Renaissance to Industrial Era Advances  
Spanish colonizers in the 16th century documented the Aztec practice of *piedra de ijada* (loin stone) testing, where jadeite’s alleged medicinal properties were verified through prolonged skin contact observations[4]. The 1784 discovery of Burmese jadeite deposits revolutionized identification protocols, as gemologists struggled to differentiate this newly available material from traditional Chinese nephrite. This led to the development of specific gravity testing, with jadeite (SG: 3.30–3.38) showing distinct measurements from nephrite (SG: 2.90–3.03)[2].  

### Modern Gemological Breakthroughs  
The 20th century introduced spectroscopic analysis, enabling precise identification of jade’s chemical composition. Jadeite’s sodium aluminum silicate structure (NaAlSi₂O₆) could now be distinguished from nephrite’s calcium magnesium iron silicate (Ca₂(Mg,Fe)₅Si₈O₂₂(OH)₂) through X-ray diffraction[2]. Recent advancements include:  
- **FTIR Spectroscopy**: Detects polymer impregnation in B/C grade jadeite[1]  
- **UV-Vis-NIR Spectroscopy**: Identifies chromium (Cr³⁺) in imperial green jadeite vs. iron-based green nephrite[6]  
- **Raman Microscopy**: Differentiates jade from visually similar minerals like chrysoprase and aventurine[13]
