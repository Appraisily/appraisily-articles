Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on the value of old hubcaps. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to ensure I cover everything thoroughly. 

First, understanding what old hubcaps value means. From the search results, it's clear that value isn't just about protection but also aesthetics, brand, rarity, and historical significance. Sources like [2] and [3] mention that some vintage hubcaps can fetch up to $300 or more, especially if they're from brands like Cadillac or Corvette. I should explain that value here refers to both monetary worth and collectible importance.

Next, the historical background. The Wikipedia entry [4] and the timeline from [5] provide a good timeline, starting from the 1680s with Newton Reaction Carriages. I need to outline the evolution of materials and designs, like the shift from brass in pre-1915 to aluminum in the 1920s, and the introduction of snap-on caps in the late 1920s. The development of full wheel covers in the 1930s and the role of hubcaps in different eras, like the 'dog dish' caps in the 40s, is important here.

For types and categories, [3] and [6] mention full wheel, partial, and central hubcaps. The center ones, especially from luxury brands, are more valuable. I should categorize them based on coverage and design, maybe also touching on materials like brass vs. steel, which affect value.

Determining factors include age, material, brand, condition, and rarity. Source [3] lists factors like patents, materials, and color. For example, brass hubcaps from the 1900s are more valuable than later steel ones. Branding is crucial; Cadillac and Ford models are highlighted in [3] and [5]. Condition-wise, original paint and lack of dents matter, as per [3] and [13].

Identifying authentic pieces involves checking logos, patents, and construction features. [3] suggests looking for spring-loaded clips from the 1930s or specific patents. Authenticity can be verified through manufacturer stamps or unique design elements mentioned in [4] and [5].

Market trends from [12] and [16] indicate a growing interest in customization and sustainability, affecting both new and vintage markets. Pricing varies widely; common ones might be under $20, while rare models can go up to $550. Etsy [10] and specialized sellers like Hubcap Mike [11] are current marketplaces.

Sourcing and selling can be done through online platforms (Etsy, eBay), antique malls [8], or specialized stores [15]. Maintenance tips from [13] include gentle cleaning with appropriate tools to preserve original finishes. Avoiding harsh chemicals is key to preventing damage.

I need to structure all this into sections with subsections, ensuring each part flows into the next. Use specific examples like the 1950 Cadillac Sombrero hubcaps [5] or Corvette models [3] to illustrate points. Cite sources properly, like the patent numbers from [3] or market growth rates from [12]. Make sure to avoid lists and keep the narrative flowing with paragraphs. Check that each section addresses the user's query points and integrates the search results effectively.

## Historical Evolution of Hubcaps and Their Collectible Significance  

### Early Innovations (1680–1915)  
The concept of hubcaps originated in 1680 with the Newton Reaction Carriage, where they functioned as grease caps to protect wheel bearings[4][5]. These early iterations, crafted from nickel-plated brass, featured threaded designs for secure attachment to wooden or wire wheels. Pre-1915 hubcaps prioritized utility over aesthetics, with manufacturers like Houk and Budd producing durable, unadorned models[4]. The introduction of aluminum in the 1920s marked a shift toward lighter materials, though brass remained prevalent for its corrosion resistance[3][5].  

### The Golden Age of Design (1930s–1960s)  
The 1930s witnessed a design revolution with the advent of spring-loaded retention clips (patent US1884238A) and decorative elements like floating chrome emblems[3][4]. Brands such as Cadillac and Hudson pioneered full wheel covers, transforming hubcaps into status symbols. The 1950s "Sombrero" Cadillac hubcap, characterized by its broad chrome brim and intricate embossing, became iconic among hot rodders and custom car enthusiasts[5]. By the 1960s, stainless steel and plastic composites enabled mass production of stylized covers, including the ribbed Corvette designs that remain highly collectible today[3][12].

## Typology and Classification of Vintage Hubcaps  

### Structural Categories  
1. **Full Wheel Covers**: Introduced by Cord in 1938, these provided complete wheel concealment and often featured ventilation holes for brake cooling[4][5].  
2. **Partial Covers**: Common in pre-1940s vehicles, these protected only the central hub and lug nuts, exemplified by Ford's "V8" logo designs[3].  
3. **Center Caps**: High-value models like the 1970s center-retention hubcaps (patent 4040672) focused on minimalist aesthetics with branded emblems[3][4].  

### Material-Based Classification  
- **Brass/Nickel (Pre-1915)**: Oxidized finishes and threaded cores, valued at $80–$500[3].  
- **Steel/Chrome (1930s–1950s)**: Reflective surfaces with embossed logos, averaging $40–$300[3][5].  
- **Plastic Composites (1960s+)**: Lightweight designs mimicking mag wheels, typically priced under $120[3][12].
