What is considered an old crock and what makes it valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** An old crock is generally considered to be a stoneware container, typically made from clay and fired at high temperatures, dating back to the 19th and early 20th centuries. These were commonly used for food storage, such as pickling, fermenting, and preserving. What determines the value of an old crock is multifaceted, going beyond mere age. Key factors include:\n\n*   **Rarity:** Crocks produced in limited quantities or by specific potteries are more valuable. For example, crocks from smaller, regional potteries that operated for only a short time are often highly sought after.\n*   **Condition:** Cracks, chips, stains, and repairs significantly decrease value. A pristine, undamaged crock will command a higher price.\n*   **Decoration:** Crocks with elaborate cobalt blue decorations, such as birds, flowers, or scenes, are generally more desirable than plain crocks. The complexity and artistry of the decoration play a significant role.\n*   **Size and Shape:** Larger crocks and those with unusual shapes can be more valuable. For instance, a very large crock with a unique design might be highly prized.\n*   **Maker's Mark:** The presence of a clear and legible maker's mark adds to the provenance and can increase value, especially if the pottery is well-known.\n*   **Historical Significance:** Crocks with documented historical connections or associations can be especially valuable.\n\n**2. How can I identify an antique crock and determine its maker?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying an antique crock and its maker requires careful observation and research. Start by examining the crock for any maker's marks, stamps, or incised names. These are usually located on the base, side, or near the rim.\n\n*   **Look for Marks:** Use a magnifying glass to examine the crock for any markings. Common marks include names like \"Red Wing Union Stoneware Co.,\" \"Norton Pottery,\" or \"Ottman Bros. & Co.\"\n*   **Research the Marks:** Once you find a mark, research it online using resources like stoneware collector websites, antique guides, and pottery databases. These resources can provide information about the pottery's history, production period, and typical styles.\n*   **Observe Decoration:** The style of decoration can also provide clues. Cobalt blue designs are common, but the specific motifs (birds, flowers, geometric patterns) can help narrow down the pottery.\n*   **Check the Clay:** The color and texture of the clay can sometimes indicate the region where the crock was made. For example, Albany slip glaze gives a dark brown interior, common in crocks used for fermentation.\n*   **Consult Experts:** If you're unsure, consider consulting with an antique appraiser or stoneware collector. They can provide expert identification and authentication.\n\n**3. What is the average price range for old crocks, and what factors affect the price?**\n\n**Answer:** The price range for old crocks varies widely, from a few dollars for common, damaged pieces to thousands of dollars for rare, pristine examples. Several factors influence the price:\n\n*   **Condition:** A crock in excellent condition with no cracks, chips, or repairs will command a higher price. Even minor damage can significantly reduce its value.\n*   **Rarity:** Crocks produced in limited quantities or by lesser-known potteries are generally more valuable.\n*   **Decoration:** Crocks with elaborate cobalt blue decorations, particularly those featuring desirable motifs like birds or flowers, are more valuable than plain crocks.\n*   **Size:** Larger crocks (e.g., 10-gallon or larger) can be more valuable, especially if they are in good condition. Smaller crocks (e.g., 1-gallon or less) are often less expensive.\n*   **Maker's Mark:** A well-known maker's mark adds to the value, particularly if the pottery is historically significant.\n*   **Market Demand:** The current market demand for specific types of crocks can influence prices. Trends in collecting can shift over time.\n\nAs a general guideline, plain, common crocks in fair condition might sell for $20-$50. Crocks with desirable decorations and in good condition can fetch $100-$500 or more. Extremely rare or historically significant crocks can sell for thousands of dollars at auction.\n\n**4. Are there any common reproductions or fakes of old crocks that I should be aware of?**\n\n**Answer:** Yes, reproductions and fakes of old crocks do exist, although they are less common than with some other antiques. Here's what to look for:\n\n*   **New Materials:** Reproductions often use modern clays and glazes that differ from those used in antique crocks. The clay may be brighter or have a more uniform texture.\n*   **Inconsistent Decoration:** The cobalt blue decoration on fakes may appear too bright or too perfect. Antique decorations often have slight imperfections or variations.\n*   **Fake Marks:** Some reproductions may have fake maker's marks. These marks may be poorly executed or inconsistent with historical records.\n*   **Uniformity:** Antique crocks often have slight variations in shape and size due to the manufacturing process. Reproductions may be too uniform.\n*   **Weight:** Modern reproductions may be lighter or heavier than authentic antique crocks.\n*   **Blacklight Test:** While not foolproof, a blacklight can sometimes reveal modern glazes. Antique glazes typically don't fluoresce under blacklight.\n\nAlways buy from reputable dealers or collectors who offer guarantees of authenticity. If possible, compare the crock to known authentic examples before making a purchase.\n\n**5. What are some of the most famous or highly sought-after potteries that produced valuable crocks?**\n\n**Answer:** Several potteries are renowned for producing highly sought-after and valuable crocks. Some of the most famous include:\n\n*   **Red Wing Union Stoneware Co. (Red Wing, Minnesota):** Known for their distinctive cobalt blue decorations, including birds, flowers, and geometric patterns. Their \"Red Wing\" stamp is highly recognizable.\n*   **Norton Pottery (Bennington, Vermont):** Produced a wide variety of stoneware, including crocks, jugs, and churns. Their crocks are known for their quality and durability.\n*   **Ottman Bros. & Co. (Fort Edward, New York):** Created crocks with elaborate cobalt blue decorations, often featuring scenes of rural life or animals.\n*   **Whites Pottery (Utica, New York):** Produced a range of stoneware, including crocks with distinctive cobalt blue floral designs.\n*   **Somerset Pottery (Somerset, Massachusetts):** Known for their salt-glazed stoneware, including crocks with intricate decorations.\n*   **Burger & Lang (Rochester, New York):** Produced stoneware with unique cobalt decorations, often featuring stylized birds and flowers.\n\nThese potteries are sought after because of their historical significance, the quality of their craftsmanship, and the rarity of certain pieces. Collectors often specialize in pieces from specific potteries.\n\n**6. How should I properly clean and care for an old crock to maintain its value?**\n\n**Answer:** Proper cleaning and care are essential for preserving the value and integrity of your old crock. Here's how to do it:\n\n*   **Gentle Cleaning:** Use a soft cloth or sponge and lukewarm water with a mild dish soap to clean the crock. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, which can scratch the glaze.\n*   **Removing Stains:** For stubborn stains, try a paste of baking soda and water. Gently rub the paste onto the stain and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing.\n*   **Avoid Soaking:** Avoid prolonged soaking in water, as this can weaken the clay and cause damage.\n*   **Dry Thoroughly:** After cleaning, dry the crock thoroughly with a soft cloth.\n*   **Display and Storage:** Display the crock in a safe location where it won't be knocked over or damaged. Store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.\n*   **Avoid Extreme Temperatures:** Avoid exposing the crock to extreme temperature changes, as this can cause cracking.\n*   **No Dishwasher:** Never put an old crock in the dishwasher.\n\n**7. Where can I buy, sell, or find more information about old crocks?**\n\n**Answer:** There are several avenues for buying, selling, and learning more about old crocks:\n\n*   **Antique Stores:** Local antique stores and antique malls are good places to find old crocks.\n*   **Online Auctions:** Websites like eBay, LiveAuctioneers, and Invaluable offer a wide selection of crocks from various sellers.\n*   **Antique Shows and Flea Markets:** Antique shows and flea markets are great places to find deals and connect with other collectors.\n*   **Stoneware Collector Clubs:** Joining a stoneware collector club can provide access to valuable information, resources, and networking opportunities.\n*   **Online Forums and Websites:** Websites dedicated to stoneware collecting offer information, forums, and resources for identifying and valuing crocks.\n*   **Books and Guides:** Several books and guides on antique stoneware provide detailed information about different potteries, styles, and values.
