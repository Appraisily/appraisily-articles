Okay, I need to tackle this query about old beer bottle identification. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's questions and see how I can address them using the provided search results.

First, the user wants to know what old beer bottle identification is and why it's important. From the search results, I see that identifying features like mold lines, pontil marks, color, and embossing are key. The importance comes from historical value, collectibility, and understanding brewing history. Sources [1], [3], and [10] mention these aspects. I should explain how each feature helps in identification and link it to the value for collectors and historians.

Next, the historical background. The YouTube video [2] talks about bottle clubs forming in the 70s, and [14] mentions beer bottles from the 19th century. I can outline the evolution from handmade to machine-made bottles, referencing the development of molds and closures. The PDF [9] has info on manufacturing techniques over time, which would help here.

For types and categories, sources [3] and [11] discuss different bottle shapes like champagne, export, and tonic. Also, categories like blob tops, hutchinson stoppers, and crown tops are mentioned. I should categorize them by era, material (glass vs. stoneware), and purpose (beer vs. soda). The eBay listings in [7] give examples of specific breweries and bottle types, which can serve as case studies.

Determining value involves condition, rarity, color, and historical significance. Source [4] lists factors like original labels and damage, while [11] gives auction prices. I need to connect these factors, maybe using examples from [7] and [11] where specific bottles sold for high prices.

Identifying authenticity would involve checking mold seams, pontil marks, and embossing. The PDF [9] explains how mold seams indicate machine vs. hand-blown, and [10] discusses pontil marks. Also, [5] warns about reproduction labels, so I should mention how to spot fakes by examining labels and seams.

Market trends: The eBay listings in [7] show current prices, and [6] talks about lightweighting trends in 2025, which might affect collectibility. However, since the user is focused on old bottles, maybe the trend towards sustainability impacts modern bottles more, but collectors still value antique ones. Source [14] mentions the rise of breweriana collecting.

Where to buy/sell: eBay ([7]), auctions ([11]), and bottle shows ([2]). Also, specialized forums like [5] where collectors discuss reproductions. I should list these venues and maybe mention online marketplaces and local clubs.

Care and maintenance: Sources [16], [17], and [18] provide tips. Gentle cleaning with distilled water, avoiding harsh chemicals, proper storage conditions (temperature, humidity), and handling. The Haffenreffer case in [17] shows how institutions preserve bottles, which can be adapted for personal collections.

I need to structure all this into sections with headers, avoiding lists and using paragraphs. Make sure each section flows into the next, citing sources appropriately. Use specific examples like the Conrad Budweiser bottles from [11] or the green Pepsi bottles in [5] to illustrate points. Check that all citations are in brackets and only include the most relevant sources per point. Also, ensure the report is comprehensive, hitting each of the user's eight points with detailed analysis and examples.

## 1. Defining Old Beer Bottle Identification and Its Significance  

**Old beer bottle identification** involves analyzing physical characteristics, manufacturing techniques, and historical context to determine a bottle’s age, origin, and purpose. This practice is critical for:  

- **Historical preservation**: Bottles serve as tangible records of brewing practices, regional industries, and consumer trends. For example, embossed brewery names on pre-Prohibition bottles (e.g., *Lemp’s Lager Beer*) document defunct breweries and their distribution networks[11][14].  
- **Collector value**: Rare bottles like cobalt-blue *Piuskegon MI ERROR* variants command prices exceeding $350 due to manufacturing anomalies and regional scarcity[7].  
- **Archaeological research**: Pontil-marked bottles from the 18th century reveal early glassblowing methods, while machine-made seams post-1900 reflect industrialization[9][13].  

The discipline gained formal structure in the 1970s with the rise of bottle clubs like the Berkshire Antique Bottle Association, which systematized identification criteria through shows and publications[2].

## 2. Historical Evolution of Beer Bottle Identification  

### Pre-Industrial Era (Pre-1870)  
Hand-blown bottles dominated, characterized by:  
- **Pontil scars**: Rough marks on the base from glassblowing rods[10][13].  
- **Non-uniform lips**: Irregularities from hand-tooled finishes[1].  
- **Dark glass colors**: Amber and green hues protected light-sensitive contents[1][4].  

Example: A 1692 English wine bottle with a “GR” monogram sold for £21,000, illustrating the premium placed on early handmade specimens[15].  

### Industrialization (1870–1910)  
Mold technology introduced:  
- **Two-piece molds**: Seams ending below the lip (e.g., *champagne-style* beer bottles)[3][9].  
- **Embossing standardization**: Brands like *Conrad Budweiser* used raised lettering for marketing[11].  
- **Closure innovations**: Hutchinson stoppers (1879) and crown caps (1892) improved carbonation retention[14].  

### Prohibition and Beyond (1920–Present)  
- **Prohibition-era rarities**: “Near-beer” bottles from 1920–1933 are highly collectible due to limited production[14].  
- **Machine-made dominance**: Owens Automatic Bottle Machine (1903) enabled mass production, with seams extending to the lip[9][12].

## 3. Classification of Old Beer Bottles  

### By Manufacturing Technique  
| Type              | Features                                  | Era         |  
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|  
| Free-blown        | Pontil scars, uneven thickness            | Pre-1870    |  
| Mold-blown        | Partial seams, embossed logos             | 1870–1910   |  
| Machine-made      | Full-length seams, uniform lips           | Post-1903   |  

### By Closure Type  
- **Cork stoppers**: Common in pre-1900 bottles; often accompanied by wire cages[9].  
- **Blob tops**: Squat, rounded lips for cork-and-wire seals (e.g., *E. Klinkert Brewing Co.* pony bottles)[7].  
- **Crown caps**: Post-1892; enabled by automated capping machines[14].  

### By Regional Styles  
- **American “export” bottles**: Swollen necks and sharp shoulders, as seen in *National Bridge White Beer Brewery* specimens[11].  
- **European stoneware**: Salt-glazed ginger beer bottles from Scottish potteries like *H. Kennedy & Co.* (1850s)[7].
