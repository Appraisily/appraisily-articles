Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on the value of Castleton China. Let me start by understanding the user's query. They want detailed information on how much Castleton China is worth, covering eight specific aspects. The search results provided include various sources about Castleton China patterns, history, care, and marketplaces. 

First, I should define what Castleton China is and why it's valuable. From the sources, I see that Castleton was an American company producing high-quality bone china, collaborating with designers like Eva Zeisel. Their pieces are collectible, especially those associated with the White House or notable designers. The importance lies in their craftsmanship, design, and historical significance.

Next, the historical background. Source [4] mentions the origins in 1901 with Shenango Pottery and the founding of Castleton China in 1939. Eva Zeisel's "Museum" line and White House connections are key points. I should outline the timeline, including production years and the company's decline.

For types and variations, the search results list several patterns like Gloria Rose, Sovereign, Sunnyvale, and Empire. Each has different designs and production periods. I need to categorize these, perhaps by era or designer collaborations, and mention specific examples from sources [3], [6], [8], and [9].

Determining value factors: Rarity, condition, pattern, and provenance. Source [4] notes that Eva Zeisel's designs are highly collectible. Condition is crucial, as chips or cracks lower value. Provenance, like White House use, adds value. Auctions and sales data from [2], [9], and [10] can provide examples.

Identifying authentic pieces involves checking marks. Castleton pieces are marked with the company name and pattern. Source [13] discusses appraisals, which can help verify authenticity. Also, comparing to known patterns from Replacements.com listings in [6] and [8].

Market trends: The secondary market is active on sites like Replacements, 1stDibs, and Poshmark. Prices vary; for example, a Gloria Rose set with 109 pieces is listed, and auction results like the Empire set selling for $325. Current demand for vintage china affects prices, with some patterns more sought after.

Where to buy/sell: Online marketplaces (1stDibs, Replacements, Poshmark), auctions (Weschlers, Apple Tree Auction), and antique stores. Mention specific examples from sources [2], [6], [8], [9], [10], [15].

Care and maintenance: Handwashing is recommended, especially for older pieces. Avoid harsh detergents and extreme heat. Storage tips from source [7] include using cushioning and not stacking too high. Proper care preserves value.

I need to structure all this into sections with headers, avoiding lists and using paragraphs. Cite sources appropriately, like [4] for historical info, [2][9][10] for pricing examples, and [7] for care tips. Ensure each section flows naturally, connecting factors like design influence on value or how condition affects market price. Check that all eight aspects are covered thoroughly, using specific data points from the sources provided.

# The Value and Collectibility of Castleton China: A Comprehensive Analysis  

Castleton China represents a significant chapter in American ceramic history, blending artistic innovation with industrial craftsmanship. Produced from the late 1930s until the 1970s, these pieces are prized for their elegant designs, collaborations with renowned artists like Eva Zeisel, and associations with historical institutions such as the White House. This report examines the factors influencing Castleton China’s value, its historical context, and its enduring appeal among collectors.

## 1. Understanding Castleton China’s Value and Significance  

Castleton China is a line of fine bone china produced in the United States, distinguished by its high-quality materials, modernist designs, and collaborations with influential designers. Its value stems from three primary factors: **historical significance**, **artistic merit**, and **scarcity**.  

The brand’s partnership with Eva Zeisel, a pioneering industrial designer, resulted in the iconic "Museum" shape—a fluid, organic design showcased at the Museum of Modern Art in New York[4]. Pieces from this collection, along with those commissioned for the White House during the Eisenhower administration, command premium prices due to their cultural and historical resonance[4][9]. Additionally, Castleton’s use of fine bone china—a material known for its translucency and durability—elevates its status above mass-produced dinnerware.

## 2. Historical Development of Castleton China  

Castleton’s origins trace back to **1901**, when the New Castle China Company—later renamed Shenango Pottery—began producing hotelware and semi-porcelain dinnerware[4]. In **1939**, Louis Hellman, a Rosenthal China representative, partnered with Shenango to establish Castleton China, focusing on premium bone china[4]. The post-war era marked Castleton’s golden age, with Eva Zeisel’s "Museum" line (1946) redefining modern tableware through sculptural forms that emphasized functionality and aesthetics[4].  

By the **1950s**, Castleton became synonymous with luxury, producing commemorative plates for President Eisenhower and dinnerware for diplomatic functions[4]. However, competition from imported ceramics and shifting consumer preferences led to Shenango’s acquisition of Castleton in **1951**, with production ceasing entirely by the **1970s**[4]. This timeline underscores the brand’s limited production window, contributing to its collectibility.
