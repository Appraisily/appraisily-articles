These tools, produced between the early 1900s and the mid-20th century, reflect Ford Motor Company’s engineering innovations and manufacturing practices. Authentic tools are distinguished by part numbers, Ford script markings, and design features tied to specific vehicle models like the Model T (1908–1927) and Model A (1927–1931). Their value stems from historical significance, rarity, and role in preserving automotive heritage. This guide synthesizes historical context, identification methodologies, market dynamics, and preservation strategies, drawing on primary sources from Ford archives, collector forums, and restoration manuals[1][2][6][18].  \n\n---\n\n## Historical Background and Development  \n\n### Early Ford Tool Kits (1908–1930s)  \nFord’s tool production evolved alongside its vehicles. The **Model T** (1908–1927) introduced standardized toolkits to empower owners with basic maintenance capabilities. These kits included adjustable wrenches, pliers, tire irons, and jacks, often marked with Ford script or part numbers[2][5]. By the **Model A** era (1927–1931), toolkits expanded to 13 items, such as spark plug wrenches and grease guns, with subtle design changes reflecting manufacturing advancements[1][14].  \n\n#### Key Milestones:  \n- **Pre-1914**: Early tools lacked part numbers and Ford branding, complicating identification. Model T pliers, for example, initially omitted screwdriver tips[6].  \n- **1928–1931**: Model A tools introduced part numbers (e.g., A-17036B for cranks) and standardized finishes, though many remained unmarked[1][9].  \n- **Post-1932**: Tools began featuring alphanumeric codes (e.g., 01A-17017) indicating production dates and applications, a system still used today[8][18].  \n\n### Manufacturing Partnerships  \nFord collaborated with toolmakers like **Moore Drop Forging** and **Herbrand** to produce specialized service tools. The **5-Z series** (e.g., 5-Z-1901 for cylinder head nuts) were dealer-exclusive tools marked with Ford script and manufacturer logos[18][19]. These partnerships ensured quality but led to variations in markings, complicating modern identification[6][8].  \n\n---\n\n## Types and Categories of Old Ford Tools  \n\n### 1. **Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Tools**  \n- **Model T Tools**: Early examples include lobster-claw pliers (T-1903 A1) and spark plug wrenches (T-5893)[5][6].  \n- **Model A Tools**: Featured in Restoration Guidelines & Judging Standards, including tire pumps (A-17050) and adjustable wrenches with 3/8\" square ends[1][14].  \n- **V8 Era (1932–1953)**: Tools like the M-01A-17017B combo wrench adopted stamped part numbers and “Ford USA” branding[9][18].  \n\n### 2. **Service and Specialty Tools**  \n- **5-Z Series**: Factory tools for dealers, such as the 5-Z-1705 rear hub puller for Model AA trucks[18].  \n- **KR Wilson Tools**: Third-party tools licensed by Ford, including valve grinders and piston ring squeezers[18].  \n\n### 3. **Aftermarket and Reproduction Tools**  \nPost-1950s reproductions often lack authentic markings.
