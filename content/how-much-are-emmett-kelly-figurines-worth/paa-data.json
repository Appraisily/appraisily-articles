Original boxes and certificates of authenticity further enhance the value.\n*   **Size and Design:** Larger figurines and those with more intricate designs generally fetch higher prices. Certain poses or themes might also be more desirable to collectors.\n*   **Manufacturer:** Figurines produced by Flambro Imports, the primary manufacturer, are the most common and recognizable.

Popular figurines, driven by market trends or sentimental value, will see price increases. Check completed sales on eBay and other auction sites to gauge current demand.\n*   **Provenance:** If you can trace the figurineâ€™s history to a known collector or a significant event, it could increase its value.

How can I identify an authentic Emmett Kelly figurine?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying an authentic Emmett Kelly figurine requires careful examination. While variations exist across different manufacturers and series, certain characteristics can help you distinguish genuine pieces from imitations:\n\n*   **Manufacturer's Mark:** Look for the manufacturer's mark, typically found on the base of the figurine. Flambro Imports is the most common, often accompanied by a copyright symbol and the words \"Emmett Kelly Jr.\" or \"Emmett Kelly Sr.\" Some pieces may also include the artist's signature.\n*   **Material:** Most authentic Emmett Kelly figurines are made of porcelain or bisque.
