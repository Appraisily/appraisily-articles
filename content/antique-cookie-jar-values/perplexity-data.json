  "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user with their research on antique cookie jar values. Let me start by understanding their query. They want a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects: definition and importance, historical background, types, value factors, authentication, market trends, buying/selling sources, and care tips. \n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. There are 13 sources, some from finance sites, collector blogs, auction sites, and YouTube. Let me go through each one to gather relevant information for each section.\n\n1. **Definition and Importance**: Sources [1], [5], [8], [12] mention that antique cookie jars are collectible due to their design, nostalgia, and rarity. They can be valuable, with some selling for thousands. The importance lies in their historical and cultural significance, as well as investment potential.\n\n2. **Historical Background**: Source [2] talks about cookie jars dating back to the 1900s, with McCoy starting in the 1930s. Source [12] adds that Brush Pottery made the first ceramic jar in the late 1930s. The golden age was 1940-1970. I should mention key manufacturers like McCoy, American Bisque, Regal China, and others.\n\n3. **Types and Categories**: Sources [1], [5], [8], [12] list various types like nursery rhyme themes (Cow Jumped Over the Moon), cartoon characters (Baby Huey, Casper), TV/movie ties (Friends Tiger jar), and manufacturers (McCoy, Shawnee). Categories could be by theme, material, or manufacturer.\n\n4. **Value Factors**: Condition is crucial (source [4], [9]). Rarity (McCoy Astronaut jar in [5]), manufacturer, design complexity, and provenance (like the Friends jar in [1]). Source [4] and [9] discuss how damage affects value, and [9] also talks about McCoy marks.\n\n5. **Authentication**: Source [9] details checking McCoy marks, glaze quality, weight. Source [12] mentions Brush Pottery's marks. Also, source [13] advises checking weight and marks for Brush jars. Reproductions might have blurry logos or lighter weight.\n\n6. **Market Trends**: Recent sales from [1], [5], [8] show high-value jars. The Friends Tiger jar in [1] is listed for $25k, McCoy Astronaut over $1k. Demand is strong for rare pieces and pop culture ties. Auctions and online platforms like eBay, Etsy are active (sources [2], [6]).\n\n7. **Buying/Selling Sources**: Sources [2], [6], [12] mention antique shops, online marketplaces (eBay, Etsy, LiveAuctioneers), estate sales. Auction results from [6] show varying prices. Authenticity checks are key when buying online.\n\n8. **Care Tips**: Source [7] advises cleaning with vinegar solution, avoiding submersion for damaged jars. For cold-painted jars, gentle dabbing with cotton swabs. Proper storage to avoid chips and cracks.\n\nI need to structure each section with headers, include examples like specific jars and their values, and cite sources appropriately. Make sure to cover all eight points, using the most relevant sources for each part. Also, check for overlaps, like the Friends jar mentioned in [1] and [8], and ensure data points are accurate. Avoid duplications and organize the information logically. Highlight key manufacturers, notable examples, and practical advice for collectors. Use citations from the sources provided, like [1] for the Friends jar value, [4] for McCoy factors, and [7] for cleaning methods.\n</think>\n\nCollectible antique cookie jars represent a niche but vibrant market, with values ranging from $50 to over $25,000 depending on rarity, condition, and cultural significance.
