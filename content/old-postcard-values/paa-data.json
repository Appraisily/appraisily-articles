What makes an old postcard valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** The value of an old postcard hinges on several factors, making it more than just its age. Rarity is a key driver. Postcards printed in small quantities, perhaps due to errors or limited regional distribution, are highly sought after. Condition is paramount; a postcard in pristine condition (no creases, tears, stains, or writing on the image side) will command a higher price. The subject matter greatly influences desirability. Postcards featuring historical events (like World's Fairs or natural disasters), famous people, specific locations (particularly rare views or scenes that have drastically changed), or unique themes (like Halloween or Christmas) are often more valuable. The artist or publisher can also significantly impact value. Postcards by renowned artists like Ellen Clapsaddle or published by companies known for quality and artistry, such as Tuck & Sons, are highly collectible. Finally, the postmark and postage stamp can add value, especially if they are rare or relate to the postcard's subject. Remember, value is ultimately determined by what a collector is willing to pay.\n\n**2. How can I identify the age of an old postcard?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the age of an old postcard involves examining several clues:\n\n*   **Postmark:** The postmark is the most reliable indicator. Look for a legible date stamped on the postcard.\n\n*   **Divided Back vs. Undivided Back:** Postcards before 1907 typically had an undivided back, meaning writing was only allowed on the picture side. After 1907, the divided back allowed for addresses and messages on one side, dedicating the other to the image. This is a crucial dating factor.\n\n*   **Paper Stock & Printing Techniques:** Early postcards (late 19th century) often used thick, heavy card stock. Later cards may use thinner paper. Look for printing techniques like lithography (often producing rich colors) or halftone printing (creating images with dots).\n\n*   **Publisher's Mark:** The publisher's name and logo can often be researched online to determine the period they were in operation.\n\n*   **Message & Address:** The style of handwriting and the address format can sometimes provide clues. For example, the presence of a zone number in the address suggests a date after 1943.\n\n*   **\"Real Photo\" Postcards:** These postcards, popular in the early 20th century, were actual photographs printed on postcard stock, often capturing local scenes.\n\n**3. What are common errors that lower the value of an old postcard?**\n\n**Answer:** Several common issues can significantly reduce the value of an old postcard:\n\n*   **Creases and Tears:** These are the most common and detrimental damage. Even a small crease can drastically lower the price. Tears are even worse.\n*   **Stains and Foxing:** Stains from water, dirt, or mold, and foxing (brownish spots caused by oxidation) detract from the postcard's appearance and value.\n*   **Writing on the Image Side:** While writing on the address side is expected, writing or marks on the image side considerably reduces the value, especially if it obscures the image.\n*   **Faded Colors:** Exposure to sunlight or improper storage can cause colors to fade, making the postcard less visually appealing.\n*   **Rounded Corners or Damage to Edges:** Damaged corners and edges are common but still impact value.\n*   **Postage Stamp Removal:** Removing a postage stamp can damage the postcard and lower its value, especially if the stamp was common.\n*   **Poor Quality Printing:** Mass-produced postcards with blurry images or poor color reproduction are generally less valuable.\n*   **Reprinted or Reproduced Postcards:** Modern reprints lack the historical significance and collectibility of original postcards.\n\n**4. How do I determine the value of a real photo postcard (RPPC)?**\n\n**Answer:** Real Photo Postcards (RPPCs) often hold unique historical value because they capture real-life scenes and people, often undocumented elsewhere. To determine their value:\n\n*   **Subject Matter:** Local scenes, historical events, occupational photographs, and images of specific individuals are generally more valuable. Consider the rarity and historical significance of the subject. For example, a photo of a small-town main street in 1910 might be highly prized by local historians.\n*   **Clarity and Composition:** A well-composed photograph with good clarity is more desirable.\n*   **Rarity:** If the scene is unique or the location is obscure, the postcard will likely be worth more. Research similar images online to gauge rarity.\n*   **Condition:** As with all postcards, condition is crucial.\n*   **Photographer:** While less common, if the photographer is known and reputable, this can significantly increase value.\n*   **Provenance:** Any information about the postcard's history or the people/places depicted can add to its value and appeal.\n*   **Compare to Sold Listings:** Search eBay (completed listings), Heritage Auctions, and other online marketplaces for similar RPPCs to see what they have recently sold for.\n\n**5. Where can I find old postcards to buy or sell?**\n\n**Answer:** Several avenues exist for buying and selling old postcards:\n\n*   **Online Marketplaces:** eBay is a popular starting point, offering a vast selection and auction format. Delcampe is another international marketplace specializing in collectibles.\n*   **Antique Stores and Flea Markets:** These are great places to find postcards in person, allowing you to assess their condition. Haggling may be possible.\n*   **Postcard Shows and Ephemera Fairs:** These events bring together collectors and dealers specializing in postcards and other historical paper items.\n*   **Auction Houses:** Reputable auction houses, like Heritage Auctions, often handle valuable or rare postcards.\n*   **Specialty Postcard Dealers:** Search online for dealers specializing in specific types of postcards or geographical regions.\n*   **Local Historical Societies and Museums:** They may have postcards for sale or be able to connect you with local collectors.\n*   **Social Media Groups:** Facebook groups and online forums dedicated to postcard collecting can be valuable for buying, selling, and networking.\n\n**6. What are some common themes or topics that make old postcards more valuable?**\n\n**Answer:** Certain themes and topics consistently attract collectors and drive up postcard values:\n\n*   **Holidays:** Halloween, Christmas, and Easter postcards, especially those from the early 20th century, are highly sought after.\n*   **World's Fairs and Expositions:** Postcards commemorating these events are popular, particularly those with unique designs or rare views.\n*   **Transportation:** Postcards depicting early automobiles, trains, ships, and airplanes are collectible.\n*   **Disasters:** Postcards documenting natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, fires) or man-made disasters are often collected for their historical significance.\n*   **Patriotic and Military:** Postcards related to wars, military personnel, or patriotic themes can be valuable.\n*   **Advertising Postcards:** Early advertising postcards featuring unique designs or promoting specific products are increasingly popular.\n*   **Black Americana:** Postcards depicting African Americans, especially those from the Jim Crow era, are collected for their historical and social significance. (Note: ethical considerations are paramount when collecting these items.)\n*   **Topographical Postcards:** Postcards showing views of towns, cities, and landmarks, especially those that have changed significantly over time, are valuable.\n\n**7. How should I store and preserve my old postcards to maintain their value?**\n\n**Answer:** Proper storage and preservation are essential to protecting the value of your postcard collection:\n\n*   **Acid-Free Materials:** Always use acid-free and lignin-free materials for storage, including sleeves, albums, and boxes. Acid can cause paper to deteriorate over time.\n*   **Individual Sleeves:** Place each postcard in an individual archival-quality polypropylene or Mylar sleeve. This protects against scratches, dust, and fingerprints.\n*   **Albums or Boxes:** Store sleeved postcards in albums with archival-quality pages or in acid-free boxes.\n*   **Avoid Direct Sunlight:** Sunlight can fade colors and damage paper. Store your postcards in a dark, cool, and dry place.\n*   **Control Humidity:** High humidity can lead to mold and mildew, while low humidity can cause paper to become brittle. Aim for a stable humidity level of around 50%.\n*   **Handle with Clean Hands:** Always wash your hands before handling postcards to avoid transferring oils and dirt.\n*   **Avoid Adhesive Tape and Glue:** Never use adhesive tape or glue to repair or mount postcards, as they can cause irreversible damage.\n*   **Consider Professional Conservation:** For valuable or damaged postcards, consider consulting a professional paper conservator.\n",
