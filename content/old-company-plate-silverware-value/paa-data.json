What is \"company plate\" silverware, and how is it different from other silverware?**\n\n**Answer:** \"Company plate\" refers to high-quality silverware produced by well-known manufacturers, often in large quantities for corporations, institutions, or wealthy individuals.  Unlike individually commissioned pieces, company plate is usually marked with a crest, monogram, or company logo, indicating its ownership.  This distinguishes it from other silverware types like antique sterling silver made for personal use, which might feature hallmarks denoting purity and maker.  Company plate frequently uses a higher percentage of silver than standard silverplate, sometimes even reaching sterling silver standards, but it's crucial to identify the specific metal content through hallmark examination.  The value of company plate hinges on several factors: the silver content (sterling, silverplate, etc.), the maker's reputation (e.g., Gorham, Tiffany & Co., Reed & Barton), the condition (absence of dents, tarnish, or repairs), the quantity of pieces in a set, and the historical significance of the company or logo it bears.  Rarity and demand also play significant roles in determining its value.\n\n\n**2. How can I identify and authenticate old company plate silverware?**\n\n**Answer:** Authenticating old company plate requires careful examination.  First, look for maker's marks, usually found on the underside of a piece. These marks might include the manufacturer's name (e.g., Gorham, Towle), a pattern name, and sometimes a date code or other identifying symbols. Second, check for hallmarks indicating the silver content.  Sterling silver will be marked with \".925\" or \"STERLING,\" while silverplate will often have \"EPNS\" (Electroplated Nickel Silver) or similar markings.  Third, research the maker and pattern online using resources like online auction sites (eBay, LiveAuctioneers), antique databases, and specialized silverware identification websites.  Comparing your pieces to known examples can help with authentication.  If unsure, consider consulting a reputable antiques appraiser or silver specialist.  Photographs of the maker's marks and overall piece are crucial for accurate identification.  Beware of forged marks; authentic marks are usually deeply engraved, not stamped superficially.\n\n\n**3. How do I determine the value of my old company plate silverware?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the value of old company plate requires a multi-faceted approach.  Begin by identifying the maker, pattern, and silver content (sterling or silverplate).  Then, check online auction sites and antique price guides for comparable pieces. Consider the condition of your silverware: minor tarnish can be cleaned, but significant damage reduces value.  The completeness of a set matters greatly; a full set is worth considerably more than individual pieces.  The historical significance of the company or logo is another factor; silverware used by a prominent historical figure or organization would command a higher price.  Finally, consult with a professional appraiser specializing in silverware. They can provide a formal valuation based on market trends and your silverware's specific characteristics.  Remember that online price guides offer estimates, and actual sale prices can vary depending on market conditions and buyer demand.\n\n\n**4. What is the historical context of company plate silverware?**\n\n**Answer:** Company plate emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the rise of large corporations and institutions.  Wealthy companies often commissioned high-quality silverware to mark significant events, reward employees, or enhance their image.  The production of company plate utilized advanced manufacturing techniques, resulting in consistent quality and large-scale production.  Many prominent American silversmiths, such as Gorham, Tiffany & Co., and Reed & Barton, produced substantial quantities of company plate.  The designs often reflected prevailing aesthetic trends, ranging from ornate Victorian styles to simpler, more geometric Art Deco forms.  Examining the design and patterns can provide insights into the era in which your silverware was made.  The historical context adds to the value, particularly if the company or event associated with the silverware holds special significance.\n\n\n**5. Where can I buy, sell, or find more information about old company plate silverware?**\n\n**Answer:**  Several avenues exist for buying, selling, and researching old company plate silverware.  Online auction sites like eBay and LiveAuctioneers offer a broad range of pieces, allowing you to compare prices and find specific patterns.  Antique shops and estate sales are other potential sources.  Specialized antique dealers focusing on silverware can offer expert advice and authentication services.  Online forums and communities dedicated to antique silverware provide platforms to connect with collectors, share information, and get advice.  Websites dedicated to silver identification and valuation can assist with research.  Libraries and historical societies may hold archives related to specific silversmiths or companies, providing further historical context.  Be cautious when buying online and always verify the seller's reputation and the authenticity of the silverware before purchasing.\n\n\n**6. What are some common problems or challenges associated with old company plate silverware?**\n\n**Answer:**  Old company plate silverware can face several challenges.  Tarnish is common, but usually removable with proper cleaning techniques.  However, improper cleaning can damage the silver.  Dents and scratches can diminish value.  Repairs, if poorly done, will significantly reduce value.  Identifying the maker and pattern can be difficult due to worn or missing markings.  Determining the silver content accurately is crucial for assessing value but requires careful examination of hallmarks.  Finding replacement pieces for incomplete sets can be challenging and expensive.  Forging or misrepresentation of maker's marks is a concern; always thoroughly verify authenticity.  Proper storage is crucial to prevent damage and tarnish; using acid-free tissue and soft cloths is recommended.\n\n\n**7.  Are there any specific resources for researching the value of old company plate silverware?**\n\n**Answer:** Several resources can aid in researching the value of your old company plate silverware.  Online auction sites (eBay, LiveAuctioneers) provide a wealth of data on recently sold items, allowing you to compare your pieces to similar ones.  Specialized price guides focusing on silverware and antiques can offer estimates, but remember these are just estimates, and actual value can fluctuate.  Websites dedicated to silverware identification and pattern recognition are invaluable for identifying makers and patterns.  Books on antique silverware and silver collecting can provide background information and valuation guidance.  Consulting with professional appraisers specializing in silverware is recommended for accurate and formal valuations, especially for valuable or large sets.  Remember that combining information from multiple sources creates a more comprehensive and reliable assessment.\n",
