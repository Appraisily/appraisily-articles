What is a Morgan Silver Dollar and how can I identify an 1887 one?**\n\n**Answer:** A Morgan Silver Dollar is a United States dollar coin minted from 1878 to 1904, and again in 1921. It features a profile of Lady Liberty on the obverse (front) and an eagle clutching arrows and an olive branch on the reverse (back). Identifying an 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar is relatively straightforward.\n\n*   **Obverse:** Look for the date \"1887\" at the bottom of the coin. Above the date, you’ll see the word \"Liberty\" inscribed on Lady Liberty’s hair band. Also, examine the stars around her head; there should be 13.\n*   **Reverse:** The reverse displays a heraldic eagle with its wings spread. The words \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" arc across the top, and \"ONE DOLLAR\" is at the bottom. Look for the mint mark (or lack thereof) which is located on the reverse, below the wreath and above the \"D\" in \"DOLLAR\".\n*   **Mint Marks:** The 1887 Morgan Dollar was minted at Philadelphia (no mint mark), New Orleans (\"O\"), Carson City (\"CC\"), and San Francisco (\"S\"). The presence and type of mint mark significantly impact the coin's value.\n*   **Weight and Size:** A genuine Morgan Silver Dollar should weigh approximately 26.73 grams and have a diameter of about 38.1 mm. These measurements can help distinguish it from counterfeits.\n\n**2. What factors affect the value of an 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar?**\n\n**Answer:** Several factors determine the value of an 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar. Understanding these factors is crucial for accurately assessing its worth.\n\n*   **Mint Mark:** As mentioned above, the mint mark is a significant factor. 1887-CC dollars are generally more valuable than 1887 dollars from other mints, especially in higher grades. The 'CC' mint mark indicates that the coin was minted in Carson City, Nevada, a location historically associated with lower mintages and higher collectibility.\n*   **Condition (Grade):** The coin's condition, or grade, is paramount. Coins are graded on a scale from Poor (P-1) to Mint State (MS-70). The higher the grade, the more valuable the coin. Look for wear, scratches, and other signs of damage. Uncirculated coins (MS-60 and above) command the highest prices.\n*   **Rarity:** While the 1887 Morgan Dollar isn't inherently rare across all mint marks, certain mintages are scarcer than others. Lower mintage numbers will generally translate to a higher value.\n*   **Market Demand:** Collector demand plays a significant role. If there's a high demand for Morgan Silver Dollars in general, or for specific mint marks of the 1887 series, the value will likely increase.\n*   **Silver Price:** The intrinsic value of the silver content also contributes. While the silver value is usually much lower than the numismatic value for better condition coins, it sets a floor price.\n*   **Eye Appeal:** The overall appearance of the coin, including its luster and strike quality, also influences its value.\n\n**3. How much is an 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar worth in circulated condition (e.g., Good, Very Good, Fine)?**\n\n**Answer:** The value of an 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar in circulated condition varies significantly based on the specific grade and mint mark. Here's a general guideline:\n\n*   **Good (G-4):** In this condition, the design is worn, but major features are still discernible. An 1887 Morgan Dollar in Good condition, without a mint mark (Philadelphia), might be worth around $30-$40. An 1887-O (New Orleans) in G-4 could fetch slightly more, perhaps $35-$45. 1887-CC in G-4 could be worth $100-$150. The 1887-S is similarly valued at around $30-$40.\n*   **Very Good (VG-8):** More details are visible compared to Good. Expect to pay $35-$50 for an 1887 (no mint mark), $40-$55 for an 1887-O. The 1887-CC in VG-8 could be worth $150 - $250. The 1887-S is similarly valued at around $35-$50.\n*   **Fine (F-12):** Moderate wear is present, but the design is clearer. 1887 (no mint mark) in Fine might be worth $40-$60, while an 1887-O could be $45-$65. The 1887-CC in F-12 could be worth $250 - $400. The 1887-S is similarly valued at around $40-$60.\n\nThese prices are estimates and can fluctuate based on market conditions and the specific coin's eye appeal. Always consult with a reputable coin dealer for a precise appraisal.\n\n**4. What is the value of an 1887-CC Morgan Silver Dollar?**\n\n**Answer:** The 1887-CC Morgan Silver Dollar is generally the most valuable of the 1887 Morgan Dollar mintage. This is due to its relatively low mintage and historical significance as being minted in Carson City.\n\n*   **Circulated Grades:** Even in lower circulated grades like Good (G-4) or Very Good (VG-8), an 1887-CC can fetch a significant premium, ranging from $100 to $250 or more, depending on the specific details and market demand.\n*   **Uncirculated Grades:** In uncirculated grades, the value escalates dramatically. An 1887-CC graded MS-60 (Mint State 60) could easily be worth several hundred dollars, and a coin graded MS-65 or higher could reach into the thousands.\n*   **Factors Affecting Value:** The precise grade, the presence of any unusual errors or varieties, and the overall eye appeal of the coin will all influence its final value.\n*   **Professional Grading:** Due to the high value of the 1887-CC, it is highly recommended to have it professionally graded by a reputable grading service like PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) or NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation) to accurately assess its condition and authenticity. A certified grade will significantly impact its market value.\n\n**5. How much is an 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar worth in uncirculated (Mint State) condition?**\n\n**Answer:** An 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar in uncirculated condition (Mint State, graded MS-60 or higher) is considerably more valuable than a circulated example. The specific value depends on the mint mark and the precise grade.\n\n*   **1887 (Philadelphia, no mint mark):** An MS-60 1887 can range from $75-$150. Higher grades, like MS-65, can fetch $200-$400 or more.\n*   **1887-O (New Orleans):** An 1887-O in MS-60 might be worth $80-$160, with MS-65 examples potentially exceeding $250-$450.\n*   **1887-S (San Francisco):** Similar to the Philadelphia issue, an MS-60 1887-S might be worth $75-$150, and an MS-65 could be $200-$400.\n*   **1887-CC (Carson City):** As previously mentioned, the 1887-CC is the most valuable. An MS-60 example can easily fetch several hundred dollars, and grades above MS-65 can be worth thousands.\n*   **Grading Service:** Again, professional grading from PCGS or NGC is essential for accurately determining the grade and authenticity of uncirculated coins. The \"grade\" assigned by these services is crucial to determining a realistic sale price.\n\n**6. Where can I buy or sell an 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar?**\n\n**Answer:** There are several avenues for buying or selling an 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar:\n\n*   **Local Coin Dealers:** Visiting a local coin shop is a great way to get an in-person appraisal and potentially buy or sell the coin. They can provide expert advice and offer competitive prices.\n*   **Online Auction Sites:** Platforms like eBay are popular for buying and selling coins. Be sure to research the seller's reputation and examine photos carefully before making a purchase. Use caution and consider purchasing from reputable sellers with high feedback scores.\n*   **Online Coin Marketplaces:** Websites specializing in numismatics, such as Vcoins or MA-Shops, offer a curated selection of coins from reputable dealers.\n*   **Coin Shows:** Attending coin shows provides opportunities to meet with numerous dealers and collectors, allowing for comparison shopping and negotiation.\n*   **Grading Services (PCGS, NGC):** While they don't directly buy or sell coins, they often have dealer directories and resources to help you find reputable buyers or sellers.\n*   **Pawn Shops:** While sometimes offering a quick sale, pawn shops often undervalue coins. This should be a last resort.\n\nWhen selling, consider getting multiple appraisals to ensure you're receiving a fair price. When buying, do your research and be wary of deals that seem too good to be true, as counterfeits exist.\n\n**7. How can I tell if an 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar is a counterfeit?**\n\n**Answer:** Counterfeit Morgan Silver Dollars exist, so it's crucial to be vigilant. Here are some tips to help identify a fake:\n\n*   **Weight and Size:** A genuine Morgan Silver Dollar should weigh approximately 26.73 grams and have a diameter of around 38.1 mm. Use a precise scale and caliper to verify these measurements. Deviations can indicate a counterfeit.\n*   **Mint Mark Placement:** Compare the mint mark's location and style to authentic examples. Counterfeiters often get these details wrong. Online resources and reference books can help.\n*   **Surface Imperfections:** Look for unusual casting marks, pitting, or a grainy surface. Genuine coins are struck with precision and should have a smooth, even surface.\n*   **Sound Test:** When dropped gently onto a hard surface, a genuine silver dollar should produce a distinct ringing sound. A dull thud could indicate a base metal composition. This is not a definitive test, though.\n*   **Magnet Test:** Silver is not magnetic. If a magnet sticks to the coin, it's definitely a fake.\n*   **Professional Authentication:** If you're unsure, have the coin professionally authenticated by PCGS or NGC. They have the expertise and equipment to detect even the most sophisticated counterfeits.\n*   **Price Too Good to Be True:** Be very wary of deals that seem too good to be true. Counterfeiters often lure buyers with low prices.\n",
