Okay, let's tackle this query about antique doll appraisers. The user wants a comprehensive article covering eight specific aspects. First, I need to understand each part of the query and map it to the provided search results. 

Starting with the first point: what are antique doll appraisers and their importance. From the search results, especially [1] and [9], appraisers assess factors like age, condition, rarity, and provenance. Their importance lies in helping with insurance, sales, estate planning, etc. 

Next, historical background. Result [2] mentions dolls dating back to Ancient Greece and Egypt, and the evolution of materials in the 19th and 20th centuries. Also, [8] talks about French and German dolls being valuable. So, the history of doll-making ties into the need for appraisers as dolls became collectibles.

Types of appraisers: The results mention different services like online vs. in-person appraisals. For example, [7] offers online appraisals at $25 per doll, while [3] does local appraisals in California. Also, [12] mentions accredited courses, indicating there are certified professionals versus generalists.

Factors determining value: Multiple sources like [4], [8], and [13] list factors such as age, condition, rarity, materials, and provenance. Madame Alexander dolls' value, for instance, depends on era and accessories [4].

Identifying authentic appraisers: Credentials are key. [9] and [11] discuss certifications from organizations like ISA or AAA. Checking affiliations and experience, as mentioned in [9], helps verify authenticity.

Market trends: The dolls collectibles market is growing, with a 4.1% CAGR [5]. Rare dolls like vintage Barbies can fetch high prices. Also, Theriault's auctions [10] are a reference point for high-value sales.

Where to find appraisers: Directories like ISA or AAA [10], local antique shops, and online platforms like Mearto [13] are options. Auction houses like Theriault's [10] also provide appraisal services.

Care and maintenance: [6] gives tips on cleaning, storage conditions, and handling. Climate-controlled storage is emphasized to prevent damage.

I need to structure all this into sections with headers, using specific examples and data. Make sure each section addresses the query points, cites relevant sources, and includes case studies like the Armand Marseille doll from [1] or the Antoine Edmund Rochard doll from [8]. Also, mention pricing examples from [5] and [4].

Check that all eight aspects are covered. Ensure citations are correctly placed after each relevant sentence. Avoid markdown in the thinking process but follow the format rules for the final answer. Use tables where comparisons are needed, like factors affecting value. Highlight key organizations and certifications. Make sure the answer is comprehensive, well-structured, and cites up to three sources per point.
