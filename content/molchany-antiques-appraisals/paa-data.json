Experts use various techniques, including examining maker's marks, construction methods, and materials.\n*   **Market Demand:** Current market trends and collector preferences significantly influence value. An antique that is currently in high demand will command a higher price. Auction records and recent sales data are analyzed to gauge market demand.\n*   **Aesthetics:** The aesthetic appeal of an antique also matters.
