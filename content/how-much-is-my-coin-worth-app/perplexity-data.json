Some might be available through numismatic societies or recommended by experts. For selling, apps with built-in marketplaces or links to auction sites are mentioned, like HeritCoin's trade feature.\n\nCare and maintenance: While the query is about apps, maybe the user also wants tips on preserving coins identified through the apps. However, the apps themselves might offer storage tips or reminders for maintenance. For the apps, regular updates and data backups are important, as seen in features like cloud storage in Coin ID.\n\nI need to ensure each section is detailed with examples from the search results. For instance, when discussing factors affecting app quality, citing CoinSnap's 99% accuracy from source [1] and Coinoscope's real-time valuations from [2]. Also, mention case studies like the review of CoinSnap in [8], where it was tested for accuracy.\n\nI should avoid lists and use paragraphs, integrating citations properly. Each section should flow into the next, providing a narrative that builds on the previous information. Make sure to cover all eight points the user mentioned, using the search results to back up each part. Check that I'm not missing any key apps or features mentioned in the sources, like HeritCoin's upcoming features in [15] or Numi's AI grading in [12].\n\nFinally, structure the report with clear headers, starting with an introduction, followed by each of the eight sections as subsections. Use ### for subsections under each main ## section. Ensure citations are correctly placed after relevant sentences, using the provided sources. Avoid any markdown except headers and bold/italics where needed. Keep the tone academic but accessible, avoiding jargon where possible.\n</think>\n\n# Comprehensive Analysis of Coin Valuation and Identification Applications  \n\nThe advent of \"How much is my coin worth?\" applications has revolutionized numismatics, democratizing access to coin identification and valuation. These tools leverage artificial intelligence (AI), image recognition, and extensive databases to provide instant insights into coin provenance, rarity, and market value.
