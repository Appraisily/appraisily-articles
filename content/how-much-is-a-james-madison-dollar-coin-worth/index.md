Okay, I need to figure out how much a James Madison dollar coin is worth. Let's start by understanding what exactly this coin is. From the search results, I see that the James Madison dollar coin is part of the Presidential Dollar series issued by the U.S. Mint. It was released in 2007, honoring the 4th president. The coin has Madison's portrait on the obverse and the Statue of Liberty on the reverse. The edge has inscriptions like the date, mint mark, and mottos.

Now, why is this coin important? Madison was a key founding father, known as the "Father of the Constitution." The coin's historical significance adds to its collectibility. But the user wants to know its monetary value. The search results mention that circulated coins are worth face value, but uncirculated or proof coins can be worth more. For example, sources [3] and [5] state that uncirculated 2007-P or D coins are around $5, and proof coins (2007-S) are about $4.25. However, a YouTube video [2] claims a specific coin is valued at $1.6 million, which seems inconsistent. I need to check if that's a different coin or an error. The video mentions a 2000-P Madison dollar, but Madison's presidency was 1809-1817, so maybe a typo? The 2007 coins are the correct ones. The high value might be for an error coin or a high-grade example, but the other sources don't mention such high values. Probably, the YouTube video is exaggerating or referring to a rare error variant not covered in other sources.

Next, historical background. The Presidential Dollar program started in 2007, as per [4] and [11]. Madison was the fourth in the series. The mintage numbers from [4] show 84.56 million for Philadelphia (P) and 87.78 million for Denver (D), which are relatively high, making them less rare. The San Francisco (S) proof coins had a mintage of about 3.9 million, which is lower but still not extremely rare.

Types and variations: The main types are the P, D, and S mint marks. Edge lettering variations (Position A and B) are mentioned in [6], where the orientation of the lettering affects value. For example, a John Tyler dollar with Position A sold for a high price initially, but values dropped as more were found. So, edge lettering position might impact Madison's coin value, but the sources don't specify if Madison coins have such variations. Also, there's mention of satin finish coins in [6], which could be more valuable, but again, not specifically for Madison.

Factors affecting value: Condition (graded coins like MS65 or PR65), mintage numbers, mint marks, errors, and edge variations. The Madison coins have high mintage, so unless in pristine condition or with errors, they aren't very valuable. The YouTube video's claim might be an outlier or a scam.

Identifying authentic coins: Check mint marks on the edge, weight (8.1 grams), composition (88.5% copper, etc.), and design details. Sources [12], [14], and [16] discuss authentication methods like checking weight, using magnets (since the alloy isn't magnetic), and professional grading.

Market trends: Most sources indicate that circulated coins are face value, uncirculated around $5, proofs a bit less. The high-value claims are rare exceptions. The [6] source mentions that coins with satin finishes or high grades (like MS67) can be more valuable, but Madison's might not have such high grades commonly.

Where to buy/sell: Reputable dealers, online marketplaces, auctions. Sources [1], [8], [15] list dealers. EBay or heritage auctions might have listings, but the user should be cautious of inflated prices.

Care and preservation: Use acid-free holders, avoid PVC, handle with clean hands, don't clean them. Sources [9], [10], [13] mention storage tips and cleaning methods, but cleaning is discouraged as it can damage value.

I need to structure all this into sections, cite the sources properly, and clarify discrepancies, like the YouTube video's claim versus other sources. Probably, that video is an exception or misinformation, so it's important to note that most Madison dollars aren't worth millions, but under specific rare conditions, they might have higher value. Also, check if the 2000-P is a different coin or a mistake. Since Madison's coin was 2007, the 2000-P might be an error in the video, so it's safer to focus on the 2007 coins as per other sources.

# The Comprehensive Guide to the Value of James Madison Dollar Coins  

## Key Findings Summary  
The James Madison Presidential Dollar, minted in 2007 as part of the U.S. Presidential Dollar series, commemorates the fourth U.S. president and "Father of the Constitution." While most circulated examples retain their $1 face value, uncirculated and proof variants can command premiums up to $12.95, depending on mint mark, condition, and edge-lettering variations[3][5][8]. Rare errors or exceptional grades (e.g., MS67) may reach hundreds of dollars, though claims of million-dollar valuations are unsubstantiated in mainstream numismatic circles[2][6]. This report synthesizes historical context, valuation factors, authentication methods, and preservation strategies to provide a definitive resource for collectors and researchers.

## Historical Context of the James Madison Dollar Coin  

### Origins of the Presidential Dollar Program  
The Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 established the series to honor deceased U.S. presidents in chronological order. James Madison’s coin, released on November 15, 2007, was the fourth in the series, following Washington, Adams, and Jefferson[4][11]. The program aimed to revitalize dollar coin circulation, though public adoption remained limited, leading to reduced mintages after 2012[11][15].  

### Design and Composition  
The obverse, designed by Joel Iskowitz, features Madison’s portrait with inscriptions “4th President” and “1809–1817.” The reverse, by Don Everhart, depicts the Statue of Liberty[5][8]. Edge lettering includes the year, mint mark, “E Pluribus Unum,” and “In God We Trust”[1][5]. Composed of 88.5% copper, 6% zinc, 3.5% manganese, and 2% nickel, the coin weighs 8.1 grams with a 26.5 mm diameter[3][5].  

### Mintage Figures  
- **Philadelphia (P):** 84,560,000  
- **Denver (D):** 87,780,000  
- **San Francisco Proof (S):** 3,965,989[3][4]  
High mintage volumes for circulation strikes (P and D) contrast with lower proof production, influencing relative scarcity[4][15].  

---

## Variations and Classifications  

### Mint Marks and Production Facilities  
- **2007-P (Philadelphia):** 84.56 million struck, valued at ~$5 in MS65[3][5].  
- **2007-D (Denver):** 87.78 million struck, similarly valued[3][4].  
- **2007-S (San Francisco Proof):** 3.97 million struck, worth ~$4.25 in PR65[3][8].  

### Edge-Lettering Orientations  
Coins exhibit two edge variants:  
- **Position A:** Inscriptions readable when the obverse faces down.  
- **Position B:** Inscriptions inverted relative to Position A[6].  
While Position A variants initially drew collector interest, market saturation has diminished premiums for Madison dollars[6].  

### Special Strikes and Errors  
- **Satin Finish Coins:** Produced for annual sets, these exhibit subdued luster and may command slight premiums[6].  
- **Missing Edge Lettering:** A rare error where edge inscriptions are omitted, potentially elevating value[6][10].  

---

## Determinants of Value  

### Condition and Grading  
- **Circulated:** Worth $1, regardless of wear[3][5].  
- **Uncirculated (MS65):** $5 for P/D mint marks[3][5].  
- **Proof (PR65):** $4.25 for S-mint coins[3].  
Grading services like PCGS and NGC authenticate and encapsulate high-grade examples, with MS67 specimens historically selling for $370+ in other presidential series[6][16].  

### Rarity and Mintage  
Despite high overall production, subsets gain scarcity:  
- **First-Day of Issue (FDI):** Coins graded and encapsulated on release dates may fetch 10–20% premiums[6].  
- **Low-Mintage Variants:** The 2007-S proof, while not rare, is scarcer than circulation strikes[3][4].  

### Historical Significance  
Madison’s legacy as a constitutional architect enhances collector appeal, though this seldom translates to substantial premiums without exceptional condition[7][8].

## Authentication and Quality Assessment  

### Key Identification Features  
- **Weight:** 8.1 grams (±0.1g tolerance)[3][5].  
- **Diameter:** 26.5 mm[5][13].  
- **Edge Lettering:** Must include “2007,” mint mark, and mottos[1][5].  

### Detection of Counterfeits  
- **Magnetic Testing:** The alloy is non-magnetic; adhesion indicates counterfeit materials[12][14].  
- **XRF Analysis:** Verifies metallic composition (88.5% Cu)[12][14].  
- **Microscopic Inspection:** Authentic coins lack casting seams or pitting[14][16].  

### Professional Certification  
Reputable grading services (PCGS, NGC) provide encapsulation and authenticity guarantees, critical for high-value transactions[12][16].

- **Environment:** Store at 40–50% humidity and 65–70°F to avoid tarnishing[9][13].  

### Handling Protocols  
- **Clean Hands:** Oils and dirt accelerate oxidation; handle with cotton gloves[9][13].  
- **No Cleaning:** Abrasive methods (e.g., vinegar, brushes) permanently devalue surfaces[9][14].  

### Insurance and Documentation  
- **Appraisals:** Obtain professional valuations for coins exceeding $500[14][16].  
- **Photographic Records:** Document obverse, reverse, and edge details for insurance claims[12][16].

## Conclusion  
The James Madison Dollar occupies a niche within the Presidential series, valued more for its historical resonance than inherent rarity. While most specimens circulate at face value, meticulous collectors can capitalize on condition-based premiums, error variants, and certified examples. As the numismatic market evolves, adherence to authentication protocols and preservation standards remains paramount to maintaining and enhancing value. Future research should monitor auction trends for error coins and reassess valuations in response to shifting collector demand.
