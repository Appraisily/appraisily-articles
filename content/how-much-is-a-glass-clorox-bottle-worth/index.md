Okay, I need to figure out how much a glass Clorox bottle is worth. Let me start by looking at the search results provided. 

First, from the Clorox Company's bottle guide [1], they mention that they don't place value on old bottles, but collectors are interested. The guide details different bottle characteristics over the years, like stoppers vs. screw caps, size changes, and embossing. This historical info will help in determining age, which affects value.

Looking at the Beachcombing Magazine article [3], they explain how to date Clorox bottles based on features like stoppers, caps, size, and texture. For example, bottles with cork-style stoppers are pre-1940, while screw caps came after. The size changes in 1933 from 15 to 16 ounces. These details are crucial for identifying and dating bottles, which impacts their worth.

The Fairfax County article [9] mentions a specific Clorox bottle from 1940-1942 with a screw cap and raised lettering, found in their collections. This shows that even empty bottles can have historical value, especially if they have specific features that date them accurately. The use of mold seams and maker's marks (like Owens-Illinois Glass Company's mark) helps in authentication.

On the valuation side, the LoveToKnow article [13] lists factors affecting bottle value: condition, rarity, color, historical significance, and demand. For Clorox bottles, original labels, stoppers, or unique features like embossing would add value. The article also mentions that colors like amber are desirable, which Clorox used, so that's a plus.

The Jacquelinestallone.com post [12] provides a list of sold Clorox bottles with prices ranging from $10 to $125. For example, a 1950s amber bottle sold for $45, while a set from the 1930s-1950s went for $75. This gives concrete examples of current market prices. The most expensive ones are older, have original caps, or are part of a set.

The Terra Americana site [8] lists dimensions and eras, like 1950s bottles with specific heights and cap types. This helps in categorizing bottles. For instance, a 1950s half-gallon bottle with a plastic cap is priced around $25.80, indicating that size and era affect value.

The eBay listings from [2] and [11] show that even individual bottles can fetch around $18-$38, depending on condition and features. The presence of original stoppers or embossing increases the price. For example, a 16-ounce bottle with a rubber stopper is listed at $18.50, while a 1920s bottle with a metal stopper is $14.99.

Factors like production codes [5] from Clorox's site help determine the bottle's age, which is key for valuation. Bottles with clear production dates (like Julian dates) are easier to authenticate, thus more valuable.

Condition issues like chips, cracks, or stains lower value, as noted in [13]. However, even stained bottles can be valuable if rare. The YouTube video [10] discusses cleaning methods, which is important for preservation but must be done carefully to avoid damage.

In terms of market trends, the bleach gel market analysis [4] mentions Clorox's prominence, which might influence collector interest. As Clorox shifts to plastic, glass bottles become rarer, potentially increasing their value over time.

To sum up, the value of a glass Clorox bottle depends on age (pre-1960), design features (stopper vs. screw cap, embossing), size (pint, quart, gallon), condition, and rarity. Authenticity is verified through maker's marks, production codes, and historical design elements. Current prices range widely based on these factors, with older, well-preserved bottles fetching higher prices. Collectors should look for original labels, intact stoppers, and unique embossing to maximize value.

# The Value and Collectibility of Vintage Glass Clorox Bottles  

Vintage glass Clorox bottles have emerged as sought-after collectibles, blending industrial design history with mid-century Americana. These amber-hued containers – once ubiquitous in households before plastic dominance – now hold value for antique enthusiasts, beachcombers, and design historians. This comprehensive analysis explores their historical evolution, valuation factors, market trends, and preservation practices.

## Historical Evolution of Clorox Bottle Design  

### Early Industrial Origins (1913–1928)  
The Electro-Alkaline Company (Clorox’s predecessor) distributed bleach in unmarked 15-ounce amber glass "pints" from 1918[1][3]. These pioneer bottles lacked proprietary markings, making identification impossible without original paper labels[1][7]. Five-gallon crockery jugs served industrial clients initially, delivered by horse-drawn wagons in the San Francisco Bay Area[1][9].  

### Branding Developments (1929–1939)  
In 1929, Clorox introduced embossed branding:  
- **Neck/Shoulder Markings**: "CLOROX" in raised solid letters[3][8]  
- **Base Trademarks**: Diamond logo with "Reg. U.S. Pat. Off."[7][12]  
The 1933 standardization to true 16-ounce pints (7⅞" tall) created a benchmark for dating[1][3]. Pre-1940 bottles featured cork-style rubber stoppers, replaced by threaded screw caps in 1940[1][7].  

### Mid-Century Modernization (1940–1962)  
Post-WWII innovations included:  
- **1945**: Grained texture on shoulders/heels[3]  
- **1951**: Transition to outlined lettering from solid embossing[1][8]  
- **1955**: Removal of capacity markings[3]  
- **1958–1959**: Flared neck designs[3]  
Plastic replaced glass starting in 1960, with full phase-out by 1962[1][7].
