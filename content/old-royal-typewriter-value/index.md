Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on old Royal typewriter values. Let's start by breaking down the user's query into the eight specific aspects they mentioned. 

First, I need to define what old Royal typewriter value is and why it's important. From the search results, I see that factors like model, age, condition, and historical significance play a role. The value is important for collectors and historians because these typewriters represent technological innovation and cultural history. For example, Hemingway's use of the Royal Quiet Deluxe adds to its value.

Next, the historical background. The Royal Typewriter Company was founded in 1904, and their first model, the Royal Standard, came out in 1906. The company's innovations, like the flatbed design, and their shift to war production during WWII are key points. I should mention the merger with McBee in 1954 and their later models like the electric typewriter introduced in 1950.

For types and variations, the search results list many models. The main categories are standard, portable, and electric. The Royal Standard and Royal 10 are notable standards, while portables like the Quiet Deluxe are highly collectible. The user provided a table in [2] that I can reference for model years and features.

Determining value factors: Model rarity, condition, historical provenance, and functionality. For example, the Royal Standard from 1906 can fetch up to $2000 if refurbished. The Quiet Deluxe used by Hemingway is another high-value example. Condition issues like rust or non-working parts lower value, while original parts and documentation increase it.

Identifying authentic models involves checking serial numbers, design features, and manufacturer markings. The Royal logo placement and specific model features, like the 'magic margin' on the KMM, are indicators. The video in [10] mentions serial number locations, which is useful.

Current market trends: Prices range from $200 for common 1950s models to over $5000 for rare or historically significant ones. Online marketplaces, auctions, and specialized dealers are primary sources. The search results mention platforms like Etsy and eBay, as well as auctions at Sotheby's.

Where to buy/sell: Online platforms, antique shops, auctions, and typewriter repair shops. The Royal Classic Manual Typewriter from [6] is a modern model but shows the brand's continued presence. Restoration services, like those in [16], add value by refurbishing machines.

Care and maintenance: Regular cleaning with compressed air and soft brushes, using proper lubricants, and storing in dry environments. The guide in [5] details repair steps, and [12] emphasizes avoiding dust and using surge protectors for electric models. Replacing platens and ribbons is also important.

I need to structure all this into sections with headers, avoiding lists and using paragraphs. Citations from the search results should be inline, like mentioning the Royal Standard's value from [1] and Hemingway's Quiet Deluxe from [7]. Including specific examples, like the gold-plated Quiet Deluxe from [2], will add depth. Tables can be used for model comparisons, but since the user prefers narrative, I'll describe them in text. 

I should also note the current date in 2025 and ensure all information is up-to-date, though most sources are from 2023 or earlier. Checking for any conflicting information, like varying price ranges across sources, and reconciling them. For instance, [1] and [4] both mention similar price ranges, so that's consistent.

Finally, ensure each section flows into the next, providing a comprehensive guide that answers all user questions with detailed examples and data points from the provided sources.

# The Comprehensive Guide to Old Royal Typewriter Value  

The value of old Royal typewriters is shaped by a confluence of historical significance, mechanical innovation, and cultural legacy. From the early 20th-century Royal Standard to the mid-century Quiet Deluxe favored by Ernest Hemingway, these machines are prized by collectors, historians, and enthusiasts.

## Historical Background and Development of Royal Typewriters  

The Royal Typewriter Company, founded in 1904 by Edward B. Hess and Lewis C. Myers in Brooklyn, New York, revolutionized typewriter design with innovations like the friction-free ball-bearing carriage and the "flatbed" mechanism[2]. The first Royal Standard model (1906) introduced a horizontal typebar alignment, improving visibility and reducing jams[1][2]. By 1908, Royal’s Hartford, Connecticut, factory solidified its status alongside Underwood as a pillar of the "Typewriter Capital of the World"[2].  

During World War II, Royal pivoted to manufacturing military hardware, resuming typewriter production in 1945[2]. Post-war models like the **Royal Quiet Deluxe** (1939–1959) became icons, beloved by writers such as Hemingway and Ian Fleming[2][7]. The 1950s saw Royal’s entry into electric typewriters, though manual models retained dominance among collectors[2][11].

## Types and Variations of Royal Typewriters  

Royal’s catalog spans over 70 models, categorized into three primary groups:

### 2. **Portable Models**  
- **Royal Portable (1926)**: The first portable, with 1920s–1940s variants worth $500–$800[1][8].

## Factors Determining Value  

### 1. **Rarity and Model**  
Pre-1940 models like the Royal Standard 5 (1913) command up to $2,000 due to scarcity[1][2]. Post-1950 portables, such as the Royal Safari, are more common, averaging $200–$400[8][10].  

### 2. **Condition**  
- **Fully Functional**: Refurbished machines with working keys, aligned typebars, and intact platens fetch 30–50% premiums[5][16].  
- **Cosmetic Flaws**: Rust, chipped paint, or missing knobs reduce value by 20–40%[4][9].  

### 3. **Provenance**  
Typewriters tied to notable figures, like Fleming’s gold-plated Quiet Deluxe or Steinbeck’s KMM, achieve auction prices exceeding $10,000[2][7].  

### 4. **Aesthetic Features**  
Art Deco designs (e.g., Royal 10’s glass panels) or mid-century colorways (e.g., 1955 Quiet Deluxe in mint green) boost valuations by 15–25%[3][7].

## Identifying Authentic Royal Typewriters  

### 1. **Serial Numbers**  
Located under the carriage or inside the frame, serial numbers correlate with production years. For example, Royal Quiet Deluxe models from 1939–1948 start with prefixes like "QDL"[2][10].  

### 2. **Design Hallmarks**  
- **Flatbed Mechanism**: Early standards (1906–1910s) feature horizontal typebars[2].  
- **Magic Margin System**: Post-1939 portables include automatic margin setters[9][13].  

### 3. **Manufacturer Markings**  
Authentic Royals display "Royal Typewriter Company" logos embossed on the frame or silk-screened on later models[9][14].
