{{< content-modules/section-header title="Types of Bottle Base Markings and What They Mean" level="2" >}}
  Glass bottle bases contain various types of markings that serve different purposes. Learning to distinguish between these markings is the first step in accurate bottle identification.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Manufacturer's Marks

Perhaps the most informative markings on bottle bases are manufacturer's marks—symbols, initials, or logos that identify the glasshouse or company that produced the bottle. These marks began appearing consistently in the mid-19th century and became standardized by the early 20th century.

Some of the most common manufacturer's marks include:

- **"O" in a square**: Owens Bottle Company (1911-1929)
- **"I" inside a circle or oval**: Illinois Glass Company (1873-1929)
- **"H over A"**: Hazel-Atlas Glass Company (1902-1964)
- **"F" in a hexagon**: Fairmount Glass Works (1930-1945)
- **"B" in a circle**: Brockway Glass Company (1925-1983)

![Closeup of manufacturer's marks on antique glass bottle bases](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/antique-identification-glass-bottle-markings-bottom/antique-identification-glass-bottle-markings-bottom-image-2_EoTVdObE_.png)

For example, if you find a bottle with "SF & PGW" embossed on the bottom, as noted by [Antique Trader](https://www.antiquetrader.com/collectibles/bottle-trademark-identification), you've identified a bottle made by the Pacific Glass Works in San Francisco, potentially dating to the mid-19th century.

### Mold Numbers

Single or double-digit numbers found on bottle bases typically indicate mold numbers used in production. According to [Glass Bottle Marks](https://glassbottlemarks.com/numbers-on-bottoms-of-glass-bottles/), these numbers helped factories track which molds might be producing defective bottles or needed replacement.

A mold number doesn't necessarily indicate a bottle's age or value directly, but it can help authenticate a bottle when combined with other markings. It's important not to confuse these with date codes, which are usually formatted differently.

### Date Codes

Some bottles feature date codes that indicate when they were manufactured. Date codes can appear in several formats:

- **Two-digit numbers**: Often representing the year of manufacture (e.g., "42" for 1942)
- **Number-letter combinations**: Where the letter represents the month and the number represents the year
- **Dot or period configurations**: Used by some companies, particularly in the mid-20th century

According to [True Legacy Homes](https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/age-glass-bottles/), date codes became more common after the 1930s when automated bottle manufacturing became standard.

### Pontil Marks

One of the most significant markers for dating very old bottles is the pontil mark—a distinct scar on the bottle's base where the pontil rod was attached during hand-blown manufacturing. 

According to the [Society for Historical Archaeology](https://sha.org/bottle/bases.htm), bottles with pontil marks generally date to before 1860, with most commercial bottles after this period lacking such marks. The presence of a pontil mark can significantly increase a bottle's value among serious collectors.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How to Identify Specific Bottle Manufacturer Marks" level="2" >}}
  Recognizing specific manufacturer marks is crucial for accurate bottle identification. This knowledge can help pinpoint production dates and origins with remarkable precision.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The most reliable way to identify manufacturer marks is to consult specialized resources. The [Society for Historical Archaeology's Bottle Website](https://sha.org/bottle/makersmarks.htm) maintains a comprehensive database of maker's marks organized alphabetically and by country of origin.

Some of the most commonly encountered American glass manufacturer marks include:

### Owens-Illinois Glass Company

Established in 1929 through a merger, the Owens-Illinois mark consists of an "I" inside an "O" or diamond. Later marks (post-1954) feature just the "I" in a circle or oval. Their marks often include date codes:
- To the right: year of manufacture
- To the left: plant number

### Anchor Hocking Glass Company

Active from 1937, their primary mark features an anchor symbol over an "H". Bottles from the earlier Hocking Glass Company (1905-1937) typically show just the "H" mark.

### Ball Brothers

Famous for their fruit jars, the Ball name appears in various script styles that evolved over time, making it possible to date their containers based on the specific logo styling.

![Collection of antique bottles showing different manufacturer marks](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/antique-identification-glass-bottle-markings-bottom/antique-identification-glass-bottle-markings-bottom-image-3_XlnMt1ByK.png)

### Hazel-Atlas Glass Company

Operating from 1902 to 1964, their mark features an "H" over an "A". The styling of this mark changed subtly over the decades, helping to narrow down production dates.

### International Expertise

While American bottle marks are well-documented, bottles from European, Asian, and other origins have their own distinctive marking systems. Resources like [Glass Bottle Marks](https://glassbottlemarks.com/bottlemarks/) offer information on international manufacturer marks as well.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Decoding Numbers and Symbols on Bottle Bases" level="2" >}}
  Numbers and symbols that aren't clearly manufacturer marks serve various purposes and require careful interpretation to properly identify their meaning.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Understanding Mold Numbers

As discussed on [Glass Bottle Marks](https://glassbottlemarks.com/numbers-on-bottoms-of-glass-bottles/), single or double-digit numbers on bottle bases typically indicate the specific mold that was used to form the bottle. For example:

- A bottle base marked with "12" likely came from mold #12 at the glass factory
- These numbers helped factory quality control identify problematic molds
- The same number appearing on bottles from different manufacturers is coincidental and doesn't indicate any relationship between the bottles

### Plant Codes and Location Identifiers

Some manufacturers with multiple facilities used numeric codes to indicate which plant produced a particular bottle. For Owens-Illinois bottles, for instance, numbers to the left of their logo typically indicated the plant location:
- 1: Toledo, Ohio
- 3: Fairmont, West Virginia 
- 7: Alton, Illinois

### Liquor Bottle Codes

Many 20th-century liquor bottles carry specific code patterns on their bases. According to bottle forums like [Historic Glasshouse](https://forum.antiquebottles-glass.com/d/2314-bottom-of-the-bottle-identification), these can indicate:

- Federal permit numbers
- Distillery identifiers
- Bottling date information
- Internal tracking codes

### Deciphering Symbol Patterns

Some bottles feature symbols rather than numbers or letters. Common symbols include:

- Dots arranged in specific patterns
- Geometric shapes (squares, triangles)
- Stars, diamonds, or abstract designs

Many of these symbols were internal manufacturer codes, though some had specific meaning. For example, certain dot patterns on mid-century glass indicated the quarter of production within a specific year.

  Bottom markings are invaluable for determining a bottle's age, often allowing for remarkably precise dating when properly interpreted.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Pontil Marks and Age

According to the [Society for Historical Archaeology](https://sha.org/bottle/bases.htm), pontil marks are one of the clearest indicators of age for very old bottles:

- Open pontil scars (rough, sharp circular marks): Generally pre-1860
- Iron pontil marks (smoother, often with a reddish/metallic residue): Approximately 1845-1870
- Absence of pontil marks: Generally post-1860 for commercial bottles

### Machine-Made vs. Hand-Blown Indicators

Examining the seams and overall formation of the bottle can indicate age:

- Hand-blown bottles (pre-1880s): Asymmetrical, with irregular thickness and often pontil marks
- Semi-automatic production (1880s-1910s): More uniform bodies but often with distinctive tooled finishes
- Fully machine-made (post-1910): Uniform seams running up to and over the lip

### Date Codes in Modern Bottles

For bottles made after 1930, actual date codes become more common, though their format varies by manufacturer:

- Owens-Illinois bottles often have a two-digit year code to the right of their logo
- Some manufacturers used a single digit representing the last number of the production year
- Others employed a letter-number combination system (e.g., G-5 might represent July 1945)

![Close-up of date codes on vintage glass bottle bases](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/antique-identification-glass-bottle-markings-bottom/antique-identification-glass-bottle-markings-bottom-image-5_cKLYslAsg.png)

### Manufacturer-Specific Dating Systems

Knowledge of when specific manufacturers operated and how their marks evolved is crucial:

- The Hazel-Atlas mark (H over A) was used from 1902-1964
- Ball script logos evolved over time, with specific styles used in particular date ranges
- The Owens Bottle Company's mark (O in a square) was only used from 1911-1929

By combining knowledge of manufacturer histories with physical bottle characteristics and specific marking details, collectors can often narrow down production dates to within a few years, sometimes even to a specific month and year for mid-20th century examples.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How Base Markings Affect Bottle Value" level="2" >}}
  The markings on a bottle's base can dramatically impact its value to collectors, sometimes turning an ordinary bottle into a prized collectible.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Rarity and Manufacturer Prestige

Some glass manufacturers are more collectible than others, making their marks more valuable to find:

- Early American glasshouses (pre-1880s)
- Limited production specialty glassworks
- Manufacturers known for artistic or innovative designs
- Companies with short operational periods

### Historical Significance

Bottles with markings that connect them to significant historical events, locations, or companies often command premium prices:

- Bottles from historically significant locations (e.g., Gold Rush era San Francisco)
- Containers from famous historical companies or products
- Bottles with marks indicating government or military connections

### Error and Variant Markings

Occasionally, bottles with manufacturing errors in their base markings become valuable oddities to collectors:

- Inverted or mirrored marks
- Double-struck or overlapping marks
- Experimental or transitional marking styles
- Prematurely discontinued marking systems

### Condition Considerations

While base markings are crucial for identification, overall condition still matters significantly for valuation:

- Clear, legible markings are more valuable than worn examples
- Damage to the base area can reduce value even if markings remain visible
- Complete bottles are generally worth more than those with just identifiable bases

According to discussions on forums like [Antique Bottles, Glass, Jars Online](https://www.antique-bottles.net/threads/bottle-identification-and-value.699141/), even common bottles can sometimes fetch premium prices if they have particularly clear, well-preserved maker's marks that help document a manufacturer's history.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Common Challenges in Bottle Base Identification" level="2" >}}
  Even experienced collectors face certain challenges when trying to identify bottle bases. Understanding these common issues can help avoid misidentification.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Wear and Degradation

Many antique bottles have spent decades or even centuries buried, underwater, or otherwise exposed to elements that can erode or obscure base markings:

- Whittle marks (irregular surface texture) can sometimes be mistaken for intentional patterns
- Chemical weathering may discolor parts of the base, making marks difficult to read
- Physical abrasion can wear away shallow embossing over time

### Misinterpretation of Numbers

As discussed on forums like [Reddit's Whatisthis community](https://www.reddit.com/r/Whatisthis/comments/10bbqy7/century_old_glass_bottle_i_found_at_work/), one of the most common mistakes is misinterpreting numbers on bottle bases:

- Mold numbers mistaken for date codes
- Plant location codes confused with production years
- Catalog item numbers misinterpreted as significant dates

### Foreign and Obscure Manufacturers

While American bottle makers are well-documented, bottles from other countries or small regional manufacturers can be challenging to identify:

- Foreign manufacturer marks may not appear in common American reference guides
- Small local glassworks often had inconsistent marking practices
- Some countries had different traditions for marking bottle bases

### Reproduction and Fake Bottles

The market for certain antique bottles has led to reproductions that can be difficult to distinguish:

- Modern reproductions sometimes include fake "age indicators" like simulated pontil marks
- Some reproductions use accurate historical marks but on incorrect bottle forms
- Others may artificially age the glass to simulate older production methods

### Incomplete or Partial Markings

Many bottles have only partially preserved markings due to mold wear during original production or subsequent damage:

- Faint embossing might capture only portions of the original mark
- Partial numbers or letters can lead to misidentification
- Fragments with only partial bases prevent seeing the complete marking pattern

When facing these challenges, it's often helpful to consider the bottle's overall characteristics—glass color, construction method, seam patterns, and finish style—alongside the base markings for more accurate identification.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Bottle Base Markings" id="bottle-marking-faqs" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do you identify old bottles by numbers on the bottom?" >}}
    Numbers on bottle bottoms typically serve different purposes:
    
    - One or two-digit numbers are usually mold identifiers used during production
    - Numbers adjacent to manufacturer logos might indicate plant locations or date codes
    - Three or four-digit numbers on mid-20th century bottles often include date codes
    
    To properly identify a bottle by its base numbers, first identify any manufacturer's mark present. Then research that specific company's numbering system, as each glassmaker used distinctive coding methods. Resources like the Society for Historical Archaeology's bottle website and Glass Bottle Marks database can help interpret these numbers in context.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What are the codes on the bottom of bottles?" >}}
    Codes on bottle bottoms can represent several different things:
    
    - Manufacturer identification marks (logos, initials, symbols)
    - Mold numbers used in production
    - Plant location identifiers
    - Date codes indicating year and sometimes month of manufacture
    - Liquor permit numbers (on alcohol bottles)
    - Glass type identifiers
    - Batch or production run numbers
    
    The meaning of these codes depends on the manufacturer and time period. Modern bottles often use standardized coding systems, while older bottles may have proprietary markings specific to particular glass companies.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What are the symbols on the bottom of glass bottles?" >}}
    Symbols on glass bottle bases typically include:
    
    - Company logos or trademarks identifying the manufacturer
    - Letters indicating the manufacturing plant or factory
    - Geometric shapes (circles, squares, triangles) representing specific glassworks
    - Dots or periods that may indicate production timing or mold identifiers
    - Stylized numbers or characters representing date codes
    
    These symbols evolved over time, with simpler marks in the 19th century giving way to more complex coding systems by the mid-20th century. Some symbols, like the Owens-Illinois "I" in an "O" or the Hazel-Atlas "H" over "A," became widely recognized industry standards.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if a glass bottle is valuable based on its bottom markings?" >}}
    While markings are important value indicators, they must be considered alongside other factors:
    
    1. **Age indicators**: Pontil marks typically indicate pre-1860 production, often increasing value
    2. **Rarity of manufacturer**: Marks from short-lived or regional glassworks can be more valuable
    3. **Production method**: Evidence of hand-finishing generally adds value
    4. **Historical significance**: Bottles tied to significant events or locations through their markings
    5. **Condition of the marking**: Clear, well-preserved marks are more desirable than worn examples
    
    The combination of these factors determines value more than any single marking. A common bottle with a clear mark might be worth $10-50, while a rare pontil-marked colored glass bottle could command thousands.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Can bottom markings help determine if my bottle is a reproduction?" >}}
    Yes, base markings are crucial for authenticating bottles:
    
    - Genuine antique marks should match documented patterns for the purported period
    - The execution of the mark should be consistent with period manufacturing capabilities
    - Certain modern manufacturing indicators (like fine stippling or extremely precise lettering) can reveal reproductions
    - The relationship between the marking and the bottle's physical characteristics should be chronologically consistent
    
    Modern reproductions sometimes include artificial aging of marks or simulated pontil scars, but these typically show inconsistencies when examined closely. Cross-referencing with verified examples in museum collections can help authenticate questionable markings.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What's the difference between a date code and a mold number on a bottle base?" >}}
    Distinguishing between date codes and mold numbers requires understanding formatting conventions:
    
    **Mold Numbers:**
    - Usually simple one or two-digit numbers (1-99)
    - Located apart from manufacturer marks
    - Don't change consistently from year to year on similar bottles
    - May appear on bottles across different decades
    
    **Date Codes:**
    - Often incorporate both numbers and letters
    - Frequently positioned in specific relation to manufacturer marks
    - Follow predictable patterns when examined across multiple bottles
    - May include period/dot configurations or specific formatting
    
    For many mid-century bottles (1930s-1970s), the manufacturer's marking system is well-documented, making it possible to positively identify date codes versus mold numbers.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I identify a bottle with no visible maker's mark on the bottom?" >}}
    When no clear manufacturer's mark is present, consider these alternative identification approaches:
    
    1. **Examine the entire bottle**: Sometimes marks appear on shoulders, heels, or sides
    2. **Consider glass color**: Certain colors were produced primarily in specific time periods
    3. **Study production techniques**: Seam patterns and finish types indicate manufacturing methods
    4. **Research bottle shape and design**: Many forms were specific to particular products or regions
    5. **Consider contents indicators**: Embossing may reveal original contents, narrowing down producers
    
    Sometimes unmarked bottles can be identified by their distinctive characteristics even without maker's marks. Local historical resources may help identify regional unmarked bottles from smaller glassworks.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are there apps or tools that can help identify bottle base markings?" >}}
    Several technological resources can assist with bottle base identification:
    
    - **Bottle Identification Apps**: Several smartphone apps now employ image recognition to match base markings with databases
    - **Online Forums**: Communities like Historic Glasshouse and Antique Bottles Net allow posting images for expert feedback
    - **Digital Archives**: Many museums and collector organizations have searchable databases of bottle marks
    - **Auction Archives**: Past auction listings often include identified bottles for comparison
    
    While technology can help, combining these tools with traditional reference books and expert consultation typically yields the most accurate results, especially for unusual or rare markings.
