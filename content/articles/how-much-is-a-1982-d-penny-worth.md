{{< content-modules/section-header title="Introduction to 1982-D Pennies" level="2" >}}
The 1982-D penny is a fascinating transitional coin that marks a significant change in U.S. coinage history. This year, the U.S. Mint changed the composition of the Lincoln cent from 95% copper to copper-plated zinc to reduce production costs. What makes 1982 pennies particularly interesting to collectors is that the Denver Mint produced both copper and zinc versions with both large and small date varieties, creating several distinct types that can vary dramatically in value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![1982-D penny showing obverse and reverse with Denver mint mark](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1982-d-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1982-d-penny-worth-image-1_YqIo8S6Fx.png)

Most 1982-D pennies are only worth their face value of one cent, but certain rare varieties and errors can be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars. The most valuable 1982-D penny is the small date copper variety, with one example selling for an astounding $18,000 in 2021. Understanding the factors that determine a 1982-D penny's value can help you identify if you have a common coin or a rare treasure.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Understanding 1982-D Penny Varieties" level="2" >}}
Before determining the value of your 1982-D penny, it's important to understand the different varieties that exist. The 1982-D penny was produced in four main varieties based on its composition and date size. Knowing how to differentiate between these varieties is crucial as their values can vary significantly.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Different 1982-D penny varieties showing large date vs small date comparison](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1982-d-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1982-d-penny-worth-image-2_Mf03gfWTK.png)

The four main varieties of 1982-D pennies are:

1. **Large Date Copper**: Common variety worth 2-3 cents for its copper content
2. **Small Date Copper**: Extremely rare and valuable, potentially worth thousands
3. **Large Date Zinc**: Common variety worth face value
4. **Small Date Zinc**: Common variety worth face value

The easiest way to distinguish between copper and zinc pennies is by their weight. Copper pennies weigh approximately 3.11 grams, while zinc pennies weigh around 2.5 grams. For accurate identification, a digital scale that measures to at least two decimal places is recommended.

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1982-D Penny Varieties and Values" description="Current market values for different 1982-D penny varieties" >}}
  <tr>
    <td>Large Date Copper</td>
    <td>$0.02-$0.03</td>
    <td>Common variety, mostly valued for copper content</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Small Date Copper</td>
    <td>$10,000-$18,000+</td>
    <td>Extremely rare transitional error</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Large Date Zinc (MS63)</td>
    <td>$0.30-$1.00</td>
    <td>Common uncirculated condition</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Small Date Zinc (MS63)</td>
    <td>$0.50-$12.00</td>
    <td>Value depends on condition</td>
  </tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Identifying Small Date vs Large Date Pennies" level="2" >}}
One of the most critical factors in determining the value of a 1982-D penny is whether it has a small date or large date. This distinction refers to the size and positioning of the date on the obverse side of the coin. While the difference may appear subtle, it can mean the difference between a coin worth face value and one worth thousands of dollars.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Close-up comparison of small date and large date features on 1982 pennies](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1982-d-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1982-d-penny-worth-image-3_NfDTQOqI6.png)

Here are the key differences to look for:

**Large Date 1982-D Pennies:**
- The "2" in 1982 has a taller, more upright appearance
- The numerals in the date appear bolder and larger
- The "8" in 1982 appears more rounded and full

**Small Date 1982-D Pennies:**
- The "2" in 1982 has a smaller, curved appearance
- The numerals in the date appear more delicate
- The "8" in 1982 appears slightly narrower

A magnifying glass or coin loupe can be helpful for examining these details. For the most accurate identification, consider comparing your coin side-by-side with confirmed examples.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="The Extremely Rare 1982-D Small Date Copper Penny" level="3" >}}
The 1982-D Small Date Copper penny is one of the most sought-after modern error coins in American numismatics. This variety wasn't supposed to exist according to mint records, as the Denver Mint was believed to have only produced small date pennies with the new zinc composition. However, a few examples of the 1982-D Small Date Copper penny have been discovered, making them extremely valuable transitional errors.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

In 2017, a 1982-D Small Date Copper penny was discovered and later sold at auction for an astounding $18,800, according to the Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS). Another similar coin sold for $17,625 in the same year. These high prices reflect the extreme rarity of this variety, with only a handful of examples confirmed to exist.

To identify if you have this rare variety, you need to:
1. Confirm it has the Denver "D" mint mark
2. Verify it has the small date variety
3. Weigh it to confirm it's the copper composition (approximately 3.11 grams)

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Value of 1982-D Small Date Copper Penny" columns="3" / / />}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors That Affect 1982-D Penny Value" level="2" >}}
Beyond the variety, several other factors can significantly impact the value of a 1982-D penny. Understanding these factors can help you better assess the potential worth of your coin.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![1982-D penny showing signs of wear and mint state conditions](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1982-d-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1982-d-penny-worth-image-4_vXIT043Hm.png)

### Condition and Grade

The condition of a coin, expressed as its grade, is one of the most significant factors affecting its value. For 1982-D pennies, particularly the common varieties, condition can make the difference between a coin worth face value and one worth several dollars.

- **Circulated Condition**: Most 1982-D pennies in circulated condition are worth their face value, except for copper varieties which are worth at least their melt value.
- **Uncirculated Condition (MS-60 to MS-63)**: Common 1982-D varieties in mint state condition may be worth $0.30 to $3.00.
- **Gem Uncirculated Condition (MS-65 and above)**: In gem condition, even common varieties can be worth $5 to $12.

### Errors and Varieties

Beyond the standard varieties, certain errors can significantly increase the value of a 1982-D penny:

1. **Double Die Errors**: Pennies with visible doubling on lettering or design elements can be worth $25 to $100.
2. **Off-Center Strikes**: Coins that were struck off-center can be worth $5 to $50 depending on the severity.
3. **Die Cracks and Cuds**: Large die breaks or cuds can add $5 to $25 to a coin's value.

### Mintage and Rarity

The Denver Mint produced over 6 billion pennies in 1982, making most varieties quite common. However, as previously mentioned, the 1982-D Small Date Copper penny is exceptionally rare, with only a few examples known to exist.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Notable 1982-D Penny Errors and Their Values" level="2" >}}
Error coins are always of interest to collectors, and the 1982-D penny is no exception. Various production errors can significantly increase the value of these otherwise common coins.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Various 1982-D penny errors including double die and off-center strikes](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1982-d-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1982-d-penny-worth-image-5_3-qd6S_q5.png)

### Double Die Errors

Double die errors occur when the die used to strike the coin receives a double impression during its creation. On 1982-D pennies, this can result in doubling visible on the lettering, date, or Lincoln's portrait. The value of these errors depends on the prominence of the doubling and the location:

- Minor doubling: $10-$25
- Moderate doubling: $25-$75
- Strong doubling on prominent features: $75-$200

### Off-Center Strikes

When a coin is not properly centered during striking, it results in an off-center strike. The value of these errors depends on the percentage of the design that's missing:

- 10-20% off-center: $5-$15
- 20-50% off-center: $15-$50
- 50% or more off-center with complete date visible: $50-$150

### Transitional Errors

Beyond the rare 1982-D Small Date Copper penny, other transitional errors can occur. A transitional error happens when a coin is struck on a planchet from a different year or composition. For 1982-D pennies, this could mean:

- 1982-D zinc penny struck on a copper planchet
- 1982-D penny struck on a wrong denomination planchet

These errors can be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars, depending on their rarity and condition.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How to Sell Your Valuable 1982-D Penny" level="2" >}}
If you believe you have a valuable 1982-D penny, such as the rare Small Date Copper variety or a significant error, knowing how to properly sell it can help you maximize its value. Here are some tips for selling your valuable penny.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Professional Grading

Before selling a potentially valuable 1982-D penny, consider having it professionally graded by a reputable third-party grading service like PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) or NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation). Professional grading:

- Authenticates your coin
- Assigns an objective grade
- Provides protection in a sealed holder
- Generally increases buyer confidence

For rare varieties like the 1982-D Small Date Copper penny, professional grading is especially important as it confirms the variety and composition.

### Selling Options

There are several venues for selling valuable coins:

1. **Online Auctions**: Platforms like eBay can reach many collectors, but require good photos and accurate descriptions.
2. **Coin Dealers**: Professional numismatists can offer immediate payment, though possibly at wholesale rather than retail prices.
3. **Coin Shows**: These events allow you to meet multiple dealers and possibly get competitive offers.
4. **Specialized Coin Auctions**: For extremely valuable specimens, traditional auction houses or specialized numismatic auctions may be best.

### Documentation and Presentation

When selling a valuable 1982-D penny, proper documentation and presentation can significantly impact the price:

- Include any authentication or grading certificates
- Provide clear, high-resolution photographs
- Detail the specific variety and any notable errors
- Include information about the coin's history if available

Proper storage and handling are essential for maintaining the condition and value of your 1982-D pennies, especially if you have potentially valuable specimens.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Handling Techniques

When handling your 1982-D pennies:

- Always hold coins by their edges
- Avoid touching the flat surfaces with your fingers
- Work over a soft surface to prevent damage if dropped
- Use cotton gloves for valuable specimens
- Never clean your coins with chemicals or abrasive materials

### Storage Options

For long-term storage of your 1982-D pennies, consider these options:

1. **Coin Flips**: Inexpensive plastic holders good for individual coins
2. **Coin Albums**: Allow for organized storage and viewing
3. **Coin Capsules**: Provide good protection against environmental damage
4. **Slab Holders**: For professionally graded coins

### Environmental Considerations

The environment where you store your coins can significantly impact their condition:

- Maintain low humidity to prevent corrosion
- Avoid temperature fluctuations
- Keep away from direct sunlight
- Store away from chemicals and potential contaminants

For copper 1982-D pennies, proper storage is particularly important as they can develop toning or discoloration over time, which may affect their value.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About 1982-D Penny Values" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my 1982-D penny is copper or zinc?" >}}
    The most reliable way to determine if your 1982-D penny is copper or zinc is by weighing it. Copper pennies weigh approximately 3.11 grams, while zinc pennies weigh around 2.5 grams. You'll need a digital scale capable of measuring to at least two decimal places for accuracy.
    
    Another method, though less reliable, is to drop the penny on a hard surface. Copper pennies typically produce a high-pitched ring, while zinc pennies make a duller sound. However, this method should only be used as a preliminary test, as wear or damage can affect the sound.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes the 1982-D Small Date Copper penny so valuable?" >}}
    The 1982-D Small Date Copper penny is extremely valuable because it represents a transitional error that shouldn't exist according to mint records. The Denver Mint was believed to have only produced small date pennies with the new zinc composition, making the copper version an extremely rare error.
    
    Only a few examples of this transitional error have been discovered, with one specimen selling for $18,800 at auction in 2021. The extreme rarity combined with the historical significance of the 1982 composition change makes this coin highly sought after by collectors.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a regular 1982-D penny worth?" >}}
    Most regular 1982-D pennies are worth their face value of one cent in circulated condition. The common varieties (Large Date Zinc, Small Date Zinc, and Large Date Copper) typically don't command significant premiums unless they're in pristine uncirculated condition or have interesting errors.
    
    Copper 1982-D pennies (Large Date) are worth about 2-3 cents for their copper content, regardless of condition. In mint state (uncirculated) condition, common 1982-D pennies can be worth between $0.30 and $12, depending on the specific variety and grade.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Should I get my 1982-D penny professionally graded?" >}}
    Professional grading is generally only recommended for coins that you believe are valuable enough to justify the cost, which can range from $20-$50 per coin plus shipping. For 1982-D pennies, professional grading is most worthwhile in these cases:
    
    1. You believe you have the rare 1982-D Small Date Copper variety
    2. You have a significant error (major double die, off-center strike, etc.)
    3. You have a perfectly preserved uncirculated specimen with no marks
    
    For common 1982-D pennies in average circulated condition, the cost of professional grading would exceed the value of the coin.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I identify a Small Date versus Large Date 1982-D penny?" >}}
    To identify whether your 1982-D penny has a small date or large date, focus on the appearance of the numerals in "1982":
    
    Small Date characteristics:
    - The "2" in 1982 has a smaller, curved appearance
    - The entire date appears more delicate and finer
    - The "8" appears slightly narrower
    
    Large Date characteristics:
    - The "2" in 1982 has a taller, more upright appearance
    - The numerals in the date appear bolder and larger
    - The "8" appears more rounded and full
    
    Using a magnifying glass or coin loupe can help you see these differences more clearly. Comparing your coin side-by-side with confirmed examples is also helpful for identification.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What other error 1982-D pennies should I look for?" >}}
    Besides the rare 1982-D Small Date Copper penny, other valuable errors to look for include:
    
    1. Double Die Errors: Look for doubling on lettering, the date, or Lincoln's features
    2. Off-Center Strikes: Coins where the design is not centered on the planchet
    3. Die Cracks and Cuds: Raised lines or bumps on the coin from damaged dies
    4. Wrong Planchet Errors: 1982-D pennies struck on planchets meant for other denominations
    5. Repunched Mint Marks: Where the D mint mark shows doubling
    
    These errors can range in value from a few dollars to several hundred dollars depending on their severity and rarity.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is it legal to keep copper pennies for their metal value?" >}}
    Yes, it is legal to keep pre-1982 copper pennies (and the copper 1982 varieties) for their metal content value. While there are regulations against melting pennies for their copper, there is no law against holding them as an investment based on their metal value.
    
    Many collectors and investors sort and save copper pennies as a long-term investment, speculating that the copper content will become more valuable over time. Currently, the copper in these pennies is worth about 2-3 cents, depending on current metal prices.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How many 1982-D Small Date Copper pennies are known to exist?" >}}
    The exact number of 1982-D Small Date Copper pennies in existence is unknown, but they are extremely rare. Based on auction records and numismatic publications, only a handful have been confirmed and authenticated by professional grading services.
    
    The discovery of this rare transitional error was only publicized around 2017, when examples began appearing at auction. Given their recent discovery, it's possible that more examples may be found in circulation or collections, but they remain one of the rarest modern U.S. coin varieties.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Conclusion: Is Your 1982-D Penny Worth a Fortune?" level="2" >}}
While most 1982-D pennies are worth only their face value or slightly more, the possibility of finding a rare variety or error makes them worth examining closely. The 1982-D Small Date Copper penny stands as one of the most valuable modern error coins, with examples selling for five figures at auction.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Understanding the different varieties and what makes them valuable is the first step in determining if your penny might be worth more than one cent. By checking the date style and weighing your coin, you can quickly narrow down which of the four main varieties you have.

Even if you don't discover the rare 1982-D Small Date Copper penny, keep an eye out for other errors and varieties that can add value. Double dies, off-center strikes, and other mint errors can turn an ordinary penny into a collector's item worth many times its face value.

Whether you're a serious numismatist or just curious about the change in your pocket, the 1982-D penny represents an interesting chapter in American coinage history. The transition from copper to zinc in 1982 created a unique set of varieties that continue to fascinate collectors and reward careful observers today.
