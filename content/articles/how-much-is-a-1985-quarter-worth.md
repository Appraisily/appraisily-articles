            A 1985 quarter is generally worth its face value of 25 cents in
            circulated condition. However, uncirculated specimens can fetch
            $3-$12, while those with rare errors or exceptional mint state
            grades might be worth $100 or more to collectors.

            The United States Mint produced Washington quarters at two
            facilities in 1985: Philadelphia (P) with 775,596,000 quarters
            produced, and Denver (D) with 519,962,000 quarters produced. Special
            proof quarters were also struck at the San Francisco Mint (S mint
            mark) specifically for collectors, though these weren't released
            into circulation.

            While most circulated 1985 quarters are worth face value,
            uncirculated specimens can command premiums. The mint mark and
            preservation quality significantly impact valuation. Quarters in
            MS66 condition or higher become significantly scarce and valuable,
            potentially worth $100 or more to collectors.

When it comes to coin collecting, value is determined by several factors: mint mark, condition, errors, and rarity. The 1985 Washington quarter, while common in circulated grades, can become surprisingly valuable in high-grade uncirculated condition or when sporting interesting mint errors.

With over 775 million 1985 quarters minted in Philadelphia alone, most examples are worth their face value. However, certain specimens can command significantly higher prices from collectors. Let's explore the factors that determine the true value of your 1985 quarter.

## Mint Marks and 1985 Quarter Production

The United States Mint produced Washington quarters at two facilities in 1985:

1. **Philadelphia (P)**: 775,596,000 quarters - no mint mark until 1980, when the "P" mint mark was introduced
2. **Denver (D)**: 519,962,000 quarters - denoted by a "D" mint mark

There were also special proof quarters struck at the San Francisco Mint (S mint mark) specifically for collectors, though these weren't released into circulation.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1985 Quarter Current Values by Mint Mark and Condition" level="2" >}}

According to the [NGC Price Guide](https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/united-states/quarters/washington-quarters-1932-1998/15918/1985-p-25c-ms/), as of 2023, a Washington Quarter from 1985 in circulated condition is typically worth between $0.30 and $0.85. However, in mint state condition with a grade of MS65, values can reach $10-$12, and specimens graded MS66 or higher can command significantly more.

The [PCGS CoinFacts](https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1985-p-25c/5918) site notes that the 1985-P Washington Quarter has a very high mintage but becomes remarkably scarce in MS66 condition and higher. This creates value for pristine specimens.

Errors can dramatically increase the value of an otherwise common 1985 quarter. Here are some notable errors to look for:

### Notable 1985 Quarter Errors and Their Values

1. **Double Die Errors**: These occur when the die used to strike the coin impresses the design twice at slightly different angles. On eBay, a [1985 double error quarter with rim issues](https://www.ebay.com/b/1985-Washington-Quarter-Error-Coins/524/bn_112541811) was listed for $250.

2. **"GOD WE RUST" Error**: This popular error occurs when the letter 'T' in TRUST is partially or completely missing. These typically sell for $10-$50 depending on the severity.

3. **Double Rim Errors**: These quarters show a doubled appearance on the rim. A [1985-P quarter with double rim error](https://www.ebay.com/b/1985-Washington-Quarter-Error-Coins/524/bn_112541811) can fetch $40-$100.

4. **Off-Center Strikes**: When a coin is struck while the planchet is not properly centered, part of the design may be missing. Values vary based on how far off-center the strike is, with 50% off-center examples potentially worth $100+.

According to [USA Coin Book](https://www.usacoinbook.com/coins/2178/quarters/washington/1985-P/), a 1985-P Washington Quarter in uncirculated mint condition can be worth $18 or more, but error coins can command significantly higher premiums.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Grading Your 1985 Quarter" level="2" >}}
Understanding how to grade your 1985 quarter is crucial to determining its value. The Sheldon Scale from 1 to 70 is used to grade coin conditions.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The condition of a 1985 quarter significantly impacts its value. Here's a simplified guide to understanding coin grades:

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1985 Quarter Grading Guide" description="How condition affects value" >}}
  <tr>
    <td>Good (G-4)</td>
    <td>Heavy wear, major details visible but flat</td>
    <td>Face value ($0.25)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fine (F-12)</td>
    <td>Moderate wear, some detail remaining</td>
    <td>Face value ($0.25)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Extremely Fine (XF-40)</td>
    <td>Light wear, most details sharp</td>
    <td>$0.50-$1.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>About Uncirculated (AU-50)</td>
    <td>Minimal wear, slight luster loss</td>
    <td>$1.50-$2.50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mint State (MS-60 to MS-63)</td>
    <td>No wear but may have contact marks</td>
    <td>$3-$8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Choice Uncirculated (MS-64 to MS-65)</td>
    <td>No wear, few contact marks, good luster</td>
    <td>$8-$15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gem Uncirculated (MS-66 and above)</td>
    <td>No wear, exceptional eye appeal</td>
    <td>$18-$100+</td>
  </tr>

For professional grading, consider services like [PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service)](https://www.pcgs.com/) or [NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation)](https://www.ngccoin.com/). These organizations provide authenticated grading that can significantly impact a coin's marketability and value.

![1985 Quarter in various grades showing wear differences](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1985-quarter-worth/how-much-is-a-1985-quarter-worth-image-5_8NUKF1lY9.png)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Where to Sell Your Valuable 1985 Quarters" level="2" >}}
If you've found a valuable 1985 quarter, several markets exist for selling your coin to collectors.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

For 1985 quarters in exceptional condition or with errors, consider these selling options:

1. **Online Marketplaces**: eBay, Etsy, and specialized coin marketplace websites
2. **Coin Dealers**: Local or online dealers specializing in numismatics
3. **Coin Shows**: In-person events where dealers and collectors gather
4. **Auction Houses**: For exceptionally valuable specimens
5. **Coin Collector Forums**: Places to connect directly with collectors

When selling valuable coins, consider having them professionally graded first. This authentication can significantly increase buyer confidence and the price you can command.

According to [Numiis Coin Values](https://www.numiis.com/coins/usa/25-cents-quarter-dollars/washington-quarters/1985-p-philadelphia-ms-mint-strike-NI.002mz/), the value of a 1985-P Washington quarter can range from $1 to potentially $100,000 for exceptionally rare specimens, though such extreme values are uncommon.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Frequently Asked Questions About 1985 Quarters" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is a 1985 P quarter rare?" >}}
    No, a 1985-P quarter is not rare in circulated condition. The Philadelphia Mint produced over 775 million of these quarters. However, they become scarce in high mint state grades (MS66 and above), where they can be valuable to collectors. In circulation, they're still commonly found.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a 1985 quarter worth today?" >}}
    Most 1985 quarters in circulation are worth their face value of 25 cents. Uncirculated examples (MS60-MS65) can be worth $3-$12, while those in premium condition (MS66+) may fetch $18-$100+. Quarters with errors can be worth significantly more, ranging from $10 to several hundred dollars depending on the error type and condition.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes a 1985-P quarter valuable?" >}}
    Several factors make a 1985-P quarter valuable:
    - Mint state condition (especially MS66 or higher)
    - Presence of mint errors like double dies, off-center strikes, or "God We Rust" errors
    - Full strike with strong details
    - Original mint luster
    - No post-mint damage
    
    The most valuable 1985-P quarters combine exceptional grade with interesting error varieties.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my 1985 quarter has the double rim error?" >}}
    Examine the rim of your 1985 quarter carefully under good lighting, preferably with a magnifying glass or coin loupe. A double rim error will show a distinct doubling of the raised edge around the perimeter of the coin. The doubling often appears as a shelf-like step or duplicate rim. Compare it with normal quarters to see the difference more clearly. This error can increase the value of your coin to $40-$100 depending on condition.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What are the most valuable 1985 quarter errors?" >}}
    The most valuable 1985 quarter errors include:
    
    1. Major off-center strikes (50% or more) - $100-$300
    2. Wrong planchet errors (quarter struck on dime or nickel blank) - $200-$1000+
    3. Double die errors with strong doubling - $50-$250
    4. "God We Rust" error with missing letters - $10-$50
    5. Double rim errors - $40-$100
    
    Value increases significantly if the error coin is also in uncirculated condition.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are 1985-D quarters more valuable than 1985-P quarters?" >}}
    Generally, 1985-D quarters from the Denver mint are slightly more valuable than their Philadelphia (P) counterparts in comparable grades, especially in uncirculated condition. This is partly because fewer were minted (519,962,000 vs. 775,596,000). In high mint state grades like MS66 and above, a 1985-D quarter might command $20-$120+, while a 1985-P in the same grade might be worth $18-$100+. However, for circulated examples, both are typically worth face value.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I sell my valuable 1985 quarter?" >}}
    If you have a valuable 1985 quarter (high grade or with errors), consider these selling options:
    
    1. Have it professionally graded by PCGS or NGC first if it's potentially valuable
    2. Sell on online auction sites like eBay or specialized coin marketplaces
    3. Contact reputable coin dealers who specialize in modern errors
    4. Attend coin shows to meet dealers and collectors in person
    5. Join numismatic forums to connect with collectors
    
    Research comparable sales before listing to ensure you price your coin appropriately.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What does a 1985-S quarter look like?" >}}
    A 1985-S quarter was minted at the San Francisco Mint exclusively for proof sets, not for general circulation. It bears the "S" mint mark below the portrait of Washington on the obverse (front) side. Unlike regular circulation quarters, proof coins have a mirror-like background with frosted, raised features that stand out in contrast. They were struck using special dies and handling processes to create this distinctive appearance. 1985-S proof quarters typically sell for $5-$15 depending on condition.

## Final Thoughts on 1985 Quarter Values

While most 1985 quarters you'll find in pocket change are worth only face value, the potential for finding valuable specimens does exist. The most value comes from coins in pristine uncirculated condition (MS66 or higher) or those with interesting mint errors.

For collectors, the 1985 Washington quarter represents an accessible entry point to numismatics. These coins are abundant enough to be affordable yet can still yield fascinating varieties and errors worth pursuing.

If you believe you have a valuable 1985 quarter, consider having it professionally evaluated or graded. The investment in professional grading can be worthwhile for coins that exhibit high-grade characteristics or potentially valuable errors.

Remember that coin values fluctuate with collector demand and market conditions, so what's valued at a certain amount today might change in the future. The information provided here represents current market conditions as of 2023.
