    {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What factors most significantly impact the value of Fanch Ledan serigraphs?" >}}
        For Fanch Ledan's serigraphs, several factors significantly impact value:
        
        1. **Hand Enhancements**: Serigraphs personally enhanced with acrylic paint by the artist can be worth 2-3 times more than standard editions.
        
        2. **Edition Size**: Lower-numbered prints from smaller edition runs (e.g., 50 rather than 300) typically command higher prices.
        
        3. **Subject Matter**: Interior scenes with references to famous artworks generally fetch higher prices than other subjects.
        
        4. **Condition**: Pristine condition with no fading, handling marks, or damage is essential for maximum value.
        
        5. **Documentation**: Complete certificates of authenticity and provenance can increase value by 15-25%.
        
        6. **Size**: Larger formats generally command higher prices, though extremely large pieces may have a smaller collector base due to display limitations.

    {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
    
    {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How does Fanch Ledan sign his artwork?" >}}
        Fanch Ledan typically signs his artwork as "Fanch" (rather than his full name, François Ledan). His signature is usually found in the lower portion of the artwork, often in the right corner, and appears in a distinctive style that collectors recognize.
        
        For limited edition prints and serigraphs, you should find:
        
        1. His hand-signed "Fanch" signature in pencil, ink, or paint (depending on the medium)
        2. The edition number (e.g., "AP" for artist's proof or a number like "125/300" indicating position in the edition)
        
        For original paintings, his signature is typically applied in paint directly onto the canvas or panel.
        
        The signature is an important authentication element, and forgeries often fail to capture the subtle characteristics of his genuine signature.
