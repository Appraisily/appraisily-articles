## Introduction to Antique Wood Planes

Antique wood planes represent some of the most enduring and collectible woodworking tools ever created. These hand-powered tools, designed to smooth, shape, and join wooden surfaces, have a rich history dating back centuries. Today, they attract collectors, woodworking enthusiasts, and history buffs alike with their craftsmanship, functional design, and beautiful aesthetics.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="What Are Antique Wood Planes?" level="2" >}}
Wood planes are specialized woodworking tools that have been used for centuries to shape, smooth, and finish wooden surfaces. Before the advent of power tools, these hand planes were essential in every woodworker's toolkit, allowing craftsmen to create straight, flat, and smooth surfaces with precision that was otherwise impossible to achieve by hand.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Antique wood planes come in numerous varieties, each designed for specific woodworking tasks. While modern planes are typically made of metal, their wooden ancestors showcase remarkable craftsmanship and ingenuity. These historical tools typically feature wooden bodies (usually beech, other hardwoods, or occasionally exotic woods) with cutting blades (irons) made of steel, and many include decorative elements or maker's marks that help with identification.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="The Evolution of Wood Planes" level="3" >}}
The basic design of wood planes remained largely unchanged for centuries, with gradual refinements rather than revolutionary changes. This consistency makes dating these tools an interesting challenge that requires attention to subtle details.

## Identifying Antique Wood Planes

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Key Identification Factors" level="2" >}}
Identifying antique wood planes involves examining several key features, from maker's marks to construction details. The more factors you can analyze, the more accurate your identification will be.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Maker's Marks and Stamps

One of the most reliable ways to identify antique wood planes is through maker's marks, stamps, or labels:

- **American Makers**: Look for names like Stanley, Ohio Tool Company, Sandusky Tool Company, and Sargent & Company stamped into the toe (front) of the plane.
- **British Makers**: Common makers include Mathieson, Marples, and Sorby, often with location information (e.g., "SHEFFIELD").
- **Continental European**: Makers like Nooitgedagt (Netherlands) or Fritz Blaser (Switzerland) have distinctive markings.

Some planes feature multiple marks, including owner's marks added later. True maker's marks are typically stamped deeply and professionally, while owner's marks may be more crudely applied.

### Dating Through Design Features

You can often date wooden planes by examining specific design elements that changed over time:

{{< interactive-modules/condition-checklist title="Dating Wooden Planes Through Features" description="Check for these features to help date your antique plane" >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Chamfered edges (beveled corners)" / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Carved decorative embellishments" / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Style of wedge and wedge finial" / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Presence of strike button (late 18th century onward)" / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Type of wood used for the body" / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Iron (blade) design and manufacturer" / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Method of blade adjustment (if any)" / />}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### Construction Methods and Materials

The materials and construction techniques can reveal much about a plane's origin and age:

- **Wood Types**: Beech was common in European planes, while American planes often used beech, apple, or maple. Exotic woods usually indicate higher-quality or specialty planes.
- **Iron Quality**: Early plane irons (blades) were forge-welded with a steel cutting edge on an iron body. Later, solid steel blades became common.
- **Joinery Methods**: How parts are joined can indicate age and origin. Dovetailed wooden plane bodies typically indicate British manufacture, while American planes often used simpler methods.
- **Hardware Details**: The style of screws, placement of rivets, and other metal hardware can help date a plane.

## Dating Stanley and Other Metal-Bodied Planes

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Identifying Metal Planes" level="2" >}}
While this guide focuses primarily on wooden planes, many collectors also encounter metal planes or transitional models. Stanley planes, in particular, have a well-documented chronology that aids in identification.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Stanley planes can be dated using a "type study" approach, examining features that changed over time:

- **Patent Dates**: Look for patent dates cast into the plane body
- **Bed Design**: The shape and features of the frog (the part holding the blade)
- **Lateral Adjuster**: The presence and style of the lateral adjustment lever
- **Knob and Tote**: The shape and finish of wooden handles
- **Trademark Style**: The specific logo version used on the blade
