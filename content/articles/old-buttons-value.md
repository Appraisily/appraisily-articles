{{< content-modules/section-header title="Introduction to Antique Button Collecting" level="2" >}}
Throughout history, buttons have served both functional and decorative purposes, transforming from mere fasteners to valuable collectibles that capture moments in design, fashion, and technological innovation. Today, antique buttons can be cherished treasures with significant monetary and historical value.

![Collection of valuable antique buttons in various materials and designs](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-buttons-value/old-buttons-value-image-1_UM3BAzLC5.png)

Antique and vintage buttons can range in value from mere cents to thousands of dollars, depending on factors like age, rarity, material, craftsmanship, and condition. While the majority of old buttons sell for under $50, rare specimens can fetch impressive prices at auction houses and among serious collectors.

Button collecting, known as "buttonology," has gained popularity as enthusiasts appreciate these miniature works of art. Whether you're a novice collector, inherited a button collection, or simply curious about the value of old buttons you've discovered, this guide will help you understand what makes certain buttons valuable and how to identify potential treasures.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Types of Antique Buttons by Material" level="2" >}}
One of the primary factors determining an old button's value is the material from which it was made. Each material carries its own historical significance and different manufacturing challenges, affecting rarity and collectibility.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Assortment of antique buttons made from different materials including metal, pearl, and porcelain](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-buttons-value/old-buttons-value-image-2_p3CjQUqfi.png)

### Metal Buttons

Metal buttons have been produced for centuries and can be made from brass, copper, steel, pewter, silver, and gold. Military buttons, especially those from significant historical periods or notable regiments, are among the most valuable.

To identify antique metal buttons, examine the back side. If the shank (the loop on the back) is a twisted wire embedded in the metal, it was likely manufactured before 1918 and qualifies as an antique button.

### Mother of Pearl and Shell Buttons

Buttons made from mother of pearl (MOP) or various shells are highly sought after. These natural material buttons reflect iridescent colors and were often hand-carved with intricate designs. Look for:

- Pearl buttons with carved or pierced patterns
- Abalone shell with vibrant blue and green hues
- Pearl buttons with painted or gilded accents

Many of the most valuable pearl buttons come from the mid-1800s to early 1900s.

### Porcelain and Ceramic Buttons

Porcelain buttons, particularly hand-painted examples from the late 19th century, can be quite valuable. These include:

- Satsuma buttons from Japan featuring intricate painted designs
- Limoges buttons from France with detailed painting on fine porcelain
- Transfer-printed designs depicting scenes or portraits

The most valuable porcelain buttons typically feature hand-painting, gilding, or unique decorative techniques.

### Glass Buttons

Glass buttons come in numerous varieties, with the most valuable typically being:

- Paperweight buttons with millefiori designs (multicolored glass patterns)
- Black glass buttons with molded designs or facets
- Gilt or painted overlay on colored glass
- Realistic glass buttons imitating other materials

Many collectible glass buttons were produced in Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic) in the late 1800s.

### Celluloid and Early Plastic Buttons

As the first synthetic plastic, celluloid buttons (from the 1870s to 1930s) have historical significance. Valuable examples include:

- Realistic imitations of tortoiseshell, ivory, or pearl
- Buttons with molded or carved three-dimensional designs
- Art Deco and Art Nouveau style celluloid buttons
- Buttons with painted or inlaid designs

Early Bakelite buttons from the 1920s-1940s have also become highly collectible.

### Fabric and Textile Buttons

Fabric-covered buttons and those made entirely of textile materials can be valuable, particularly:

- Passementerie buttons (made with elaborate thread work)
- Buttons with petit point or micro-embroidery
- Woven silk or metallic thread buttons
- Buttons incorporating beadwork or sequins

These buttons are sometimes quite fragile, so excellent condition significantly increases value.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors That Determine Button Value" level="2" >}}
Beyond material, several key factors affect the value of antique buttons. Understanding these elements will help you identify potentially valuable specimens in any collection.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Close-up of rare antique buttons with intricate detailing and unique designs](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-buttons-value/old-buttons-value-image-3__YGEpfyF_.png)

### Age and Rarity

Generally, the older the button, the more valuable it may beâ€”particularly if it represents an early manufacturing technique or historical period. Buttons from the 18th and early 19th centuries are typically more valuable than those from the late 19th or early 20th centuries due to their comparative rarity.

Buttons with limited production runs or from short-lived factories often command higher prices. For example, buttons from Prosser's Aetna Button Works (1841-1852) are highly sought after by collectors.

### Design and Artistic Merit

Buttons featuring exceptional artistry, craftsmanship, or innovative design tend to be more valuable. Look for:

- Intricate miniature scenes
- Unusual or complex manufacturing techniques
- Buttons signed by known artists or designers
- Buttons reflecting important art movements (Art Nouveau, Art Deco)

### Historical Significance

Buttons connected to significant historical events, notable figures, or important social movements can carry premium values:

- Buttons from military uniforms of important conflicts
- Political campaign buttons from the 19th century
- Buttons featuring emerging technologies of their era
- Commemorative buttons for historical events

### Condition

As with most collectibles, condition significantly impacts value. Buttons in mint or near-mint condition are worth substantially more than damaged examples. Issues that diminish value include:

- Chips, cracks, or significant wear
- Fading or color loss
- Bent or damaged shanks
- Corrosion or tarnishing

### Provenance and Documentation

Buttons with documented history or provenance typically command higher prices:

- Known origin from a specific maker or region
- Original button cards or packaging
- Documentation of previous ownership
- Connection to noteworthy collections

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Most Valuable Types of Antique Buttons" level="2" >}}
While most old buttons have modest values, certain types consistently command premium prices. Understanding these categories can help you identify potential treasures.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Picture Buttons

Picture buttons (also called "story buttons") from the late 19th century feature detailed scenes, often illustrating literary works, fables, or historical events. Made primarily in France and England, these pressed brass buttons with pictorial designs are highly collectible.

Complete themed sets of picture buttons can sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars, while individual examples typically range from $15-$50 each.

### Black Glass with Gold or Silver Decoration

Black glass buttons with inlaid or painted gold or silver designs, particularly those from the Victorian era, are highly desirable. These buttons featured intricate patterns, often with star motifs or floral designs. Good examples can sell for $30-$100 each.

### Enamel and Precious Metal Buttons

Buttons combining precious metals (gold or silver) with enamel work represent some of the highest-value antique buttons. These include:

- 18th-century French enamel buttons
- Buttons with cloisonnÃ© or champlevÃ© enamel techniques
- Buttons by notable jewelers or silversmiths

Fine examples of enamel and precious metal buttons can sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars each. A pair of enamel and 18K gold cuff buttons recently valued around $3,900 demonstrates the upper end of this market.

### Elaborately Carved Pearl Buttons

Mother of pearl buttons with exceptional carving, particularly those featuring intricate scenes, animals, or architectural elements, can be quite valuable. The finest examples from the Victorian era can sell for $50-$200 per button, with extremely rare specimens commanding even more.

### Military and Uniform Buttons

Military buttons, especially those from significant historical periods or prestigious regiments, can be highly valuable to both button collectors and military memorabilia enthusiasts. Revolutionary War, Civil War, and War of 1812 military buttons are particularly prized, with some rare examples selling for hundreds of dollars each.

### Realistic and Pictorial Celluloid Buttons

Although celluloid is a relatively modern material compared to other antique button types, certain celluloid buttons from the late 19th and early 20th centuries are highly collectible. The most valuable examples feature:

- Realistic imitations of natural materials
- Three-dimensional molded designs
- Painted scenes or portraits
- Art Nouveau or Art Deco styling

Outstanding examples can sell for $25-$75 each, with rare specimens commanding even more.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How to Identify Valuable Buttons in Your Collection" level="2" >}}
With the vast variety of button types and designs, identifying potentially valuable specimens requires careful examination and research.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Person examining antique buttons with magnifying glass to identify valuable specimens](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-buttons-value/old-buttons-value-image-5_X1vBg3Vmg-.png)

### Step 1: Determine the Material

The first step in button identification is determining the material. This can sometimes be challenging, as many buttons were designed to imitate more expensive materials. Some identification tips:

- **Pearl vs. Plastic**: Pearl feels cool to the touch and has a distinctive iridescence that changes with lighting angles
- **Metal Content**: Use a magnet to test for ferrous metals
- **Glass vs. Plastic**: Glass feels cooler and heavier than plastic of similar size
- **Porcelain vs. Glass**: Porcelain has a slightly matte finish compared to glass

### Step 2: Look for Markings and Signatures

Examine the back of the button carefully, using magnification if necessary:

- **Maker's Marks**: Some high-quality buttons were signed or marked by their makers
- **Country of Origin**: "Made in..." markings (though these generally indicate post-1891 manufacture)
- **Metal Content**: Marks like "sterling" or "800" indicating silver content
- **Patent Dates**: Can help establish the earliest possible manufacture date

### Step 3: Assess the Construction and Technology

The method of attachment and construction techniques can help date buttons:

- **Shanks**: Wire shanks embedded in metal indicate pre-1918 manufacture
- **Two-Piece Construction**: Examine how components are joined
- **Back Patterns**: The pattern on the back of metal buttons can indicate age and origin
- **Manufacturing Techniques**: Hand-sewn holes vs. machine-drilled, hand-painting vs. transfer printing

### Step 4: Research Similar Examples

Compare your buttons to documented examples:

- Button collector reference books
- Museum collections online
- Auction house archives
- Button collector association websites and publications

### Step 5: Consult Specialists

For potentially valuable buttons, consider getting expert opinions:

- Local antique appraisers
- Button collector clubs and organizations
- Specialized online forums
- Auction houses with expertise in textiles and accessories

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Old Button Values" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Do old buttons have any value?" >}}
    Yes, antique buttons can be quite valuable. While most old buttons sell for under $50 each, rare specimens can fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Buttons made of precious materials (gold, silver, fine enamel), those with exceptional artistry, and buttons with historical significance tend to be the most valuable. Military buttons, hand-painted porcelain buttons, and carved mother of pearl buttons from the 19th century are particularly sought after by collectors.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I identify the age of an old button?" >}}
    Several clues can help determine a button's age:
    
    - Construction method: For metal buttons, twisted wire shanks embedded in the metal typically indicate pre-1918 manufacture
    - Materials: Certain materials were only used during specific time periods
    - Manufacturing techniques: Hand-sewing vs. machine drilling, hand-painting vs. transfer printing
    - Back patterns: The pattern on the back of metal buttons can indicate age and origin
    - Markings: "Made in..." markings generally indicate post-1891 manufacture
    - Patent dates or maker's marks can provide exact dating clues
    
    For precise identification, consider consulting button collecting guides or experts at organizations like the National Button Society.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What types of old buttons are the most valuable?" >}}
    The most valuable antique buttons typically include:
    
    - Buttons made of precious metals (gold, silver) with fine enamel work
    - Buttons with historical significance, especially military buttons from significant conflicts
    - Hand-painted porcelain buttons, particularly French Limoges and Japanese Satsuma
    - Intricately carved mother of pearl buttons
    - Complete sets of Victorian-era "picture buttons" depicting literary or historical themes
    - Buttons made by known jewelry houses or with artist signatures
    - Extremely rare examples with documented provenance
    
    Condition is also crucial - buttons in mint or near-mint condition command much higher prices than damaged examples.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where can I sell valuable old buttons?" >}}
    For selling valuable antique buttons, consider these options:
    
    - Specialized button dealers who attend button shows and conventions
    - Auction houses (for high-value examples)
    - Online marketplaces like eBay, Etsy, and Ruby Lane
    - Antique shops and malls
    - Direct sales to button collectors through collector clubs and organizations
    - Online button collector forums and groups
    
    The best venue depends on the value and rarity of your buttons. For very valuable specimens, specialist dealers or auction houses might offer the best returns, while online marketplaces work well for more common collectible buttons.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Can you donate old buttons?" >}}
    Yes, there are several options for donating old buttons:
    
    - Charity shops and thrift stores often accept button donations
    - Craft guilds and organizations that use vintage materials
    - Schools and children's programs for art projects
    - Theater costume departments
    - Button museums and historical societies (for historically significant examples)
    - Textile recycling programs
    
    For valuable antique buttons, consider donating to museum collections where they can be preserved and studied. For more common buttons, craft reuse programs ensure they'll find new life in creative projects.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are old political or campaign buttons valuable?" >}}
    Yes, vintage political and campaign buttons can be quite valuable, though these typically fall into a different collecting category than clothing buttons. 
    
    Political pinback buttons from the late 19th and early 20th centuries are particularly collectible. Buttons featuring presidential candidates from before 1920 can be worth $10-$25 each in good condition, while rare examples from the earliest campaigns can sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
    
    The value depends on factors like:
    - Age (generally older buttons are more valuable)
    - Historical significance of the campaign
    - Condition
    - Rarity of the design
    - Size and visual appeal
    
    For specific valuation of political buttons, specialists in political memorabilia would be the best resource.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How should I store valuable antique buttons?" >}}
    Proper storage is essential for preserving the value and condition of antique buttons:
    
    - Use acid-free materials for all storage containers and cards
    - Avoid rubber bands, tape, or adhesives that can damage buttons
    - Store in a climate-controlled environment away from extreme temperature and humidity fluctuations
    - Keep away from direct sunlight to prevent fading
    - Consider archival button boxes with individual compartments
    - For display purposes, use UV-filtering glass or acrylic
    - If mounting buttons, use archival-quality thread and avoid glue
    - Keep metal buttons separate to prevent tarnish transfer
    
    Many serious collectors use specialized button trays or mount buttons on acid-free cards with documentation of their history and provenance.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is there an app for identifying vintage buttons?" >}}
    While there isn't yet a dedicated app specifically for vintage button identification, several resources can help:
    
    - General antique identification apps like Google Lens can sometimes provide useful starting points
    - Online button collector forums where you can upload images for expert feedback
    - The National Button Society website offers identification resources
    - Reference books with detailed photographs remain the most reliable identification tools
    
    The complex nature of button identificationâ€”requiring assessment of materials, construction techniques, and design elementsâ€”makes human expertise still more reliable than current AI technology for this specific collectible category.

## Conclusion

The world of antique button collecting offers something for everyone, from casual enthusiasts to serious collectors and investors. While most old buttons have modest monetary value, the historical insights, artistic craftsmanship, and pure collecting enjoyment they provide make them worthwhile collectibles regardless of price.

Whether you're sorting through an inherited button collection, hunting for treasures at estate sales, or building a specialized collection around a theme, understanding what makes certain buttons valuable can enhance your appreciation of these miniature artifacts. From precious metals and fine enamels to intricate carvings and historical connections, antique buttons capture centuries of design evolution in pocket-sized treasures.

As with any collectible, education is key to identifying potential treasures. By learning about materials, manufacturing techniques, and historical contexts, you'll develop the eye needed to spot valuable specimens that others might overlook. And regardless of monetary value, each button tells a story of its eraâ€”a small but significant connection to our shared past.
