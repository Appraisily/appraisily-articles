{{< visual-modules/timeline title="Historical Light Socket Evolution" >}}
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1880s" title="Early Edison Sockets" >}}
    Thomas Edison's first commercial light sockets were made of brass with porcelain insulation. These early designs featured simple screw terminals for connecting wires and no built-in switches.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1890s" title="Introduction of Key Switches" >}}
    The rotating brass key switch became standard, allowing users to turn lights on and off without unscrewing the bulb. These sockets were primarily made of brass with porcelain interiors.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1900-1915" title="Pull Chain Innovation" >}}
    Pull chain sockets emerged, offering a more convenient switching mechanism. Manufacturers began using more standardized designs with interchangeable parts.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1920s-1930s" title="Bakelite Revolution" >}}
    The introduction of Bakelite and other early plastics transformed socket manufacturing. These materials provided better insulation and allowed for more mass production.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Can I use modern bulbs in antique light sockets?" >}}
    Modern bulbs can generally be used in antique sockets with these considerations:
    
    - Check the socket's wattage rating (typically stamped inside)
    - Vintage sockets were often rated for lower wattage (40-60W) than modern fixtures
    - LED bulbs are safer choices as they produce less heat
    - Ensure the base size matches (E26/E27 for standard, E12 for candelabra)
    - Consider reproduction "Edison" style LED bulbs for authentic appearance
    
    Always ensure the socket has been inspected and is in safe working condition before installing any bulb.
