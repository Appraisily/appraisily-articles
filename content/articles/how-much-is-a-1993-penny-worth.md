## Introduction to 1993 Pennies

The 1993 Lincoln Memorial cent is a common coin that most Americans have likely encountered in circulation. While most 1993 pennies are worth only their face value of one cent, certain varieties and errors can be surprisingly valuable to collectors. This comprehensive guide will help you determine the true value of your 1993 penny, whether it's a regular strike from Philadelphia, Denver, or San Francisco, or a rare error coin worth thousands.

![A 1993 Lincoln Memorial penny showing the obverse with Lincoln's profile and the reverse with the Lincoln Memorial](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1993-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1993-penny-worth-image-1_fNVvlVkWT.png)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1993 Penny Overview" level="2" >}}
The 1993 penny is part of the Lincoln Memorial cent series that was produced from 1959 to 2008. These coins feature Abraham Lincoln's profile on the obverse (designed by Victor David Brenner) and the Lincoln Memorial on the reverse (designed by Frank Gasparro). In 1993, pennies were minted at three different facilities: Philadelphia (no mint mark), Denver (D mint mark), and San Francisco (S mint mark for proof coins only).

## 1993 Penny Values by Mint Mark

The value of a 1993 penny largely depends on its mint mark, condition, and whether it contains any errors or varieties. Let's explore the value of each type in detail.

![A close-up of a 1993-D penny showing the mint mark below the date](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1993-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1993-penny-worth-image-2_T2OONkcX1.png)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1993 No Mint Mark (Philadelphia) Penny" level="3" >}}
Philadelphia-minted 1993 pennies have no mint mark and were produced in large quantities. While most are worth only face value in circulation, uncirculated specimens can be worth significantly more, particularly those in pristine condition.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

<tr>

{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

According to [USA Coin Book](https://www.usacoinbook.com/coins/601/small-cents/lincoln-memorial-cent/1993-P/), the estimated value of an uncirculated 1993 Lincoln Memorial Penny is about $0.36, though as noted above, specimens in extraordinary condition can be worth much more.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1993-D (Denver) Penny" level="3" >}}
The Denver Mint produced over 6.4 billion pennies in 1993, making it the highest production of the three mints that year. These coins feature a small "D" mint mark below the date on the obverse side. Like the Philadelphia pennies, most 1993-D cents are worth face value unless they're in uncirculated condition or feature errors.

According to [Coin Appraiser](https://coinappraiser.com/coins/value-of-1993-d-lincoln-memorial-cent/), the 1993-D penny has a diameter of 19mm and weighs 2.50 grams, matching the standard specifications for modern Lincoln cents.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1993-S (San Francisco) Proof Penny" level="3" >}}
The San Francisco Mint produced special proof versions of the 1993 penny exclusively for collectors. These were not intended for circulation and feature a mirror-like finish, sharper details, and a small "S" mint mark below the date. Proof coins were only available in official proof sets sold by the U.S. Mint.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![A close-up of a 1993-S proof penny showing its mirror-like finish and S mint mark](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1993-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1993-penny-worth-image-3_SitblpMnj.png)

{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

According to [Toolify.ai](https://www.toolify.ai/gpts/discover-the-hidden-value-of-your-1993-penny-135020), a perfect 1993-S proof penny (PR70) can sell for over $90, making it one of the more valuable 1993 pennies for collectors.

## Valuable 1993 Penny Errors and Varieties

While most 1993 pennies are common and worth face value, certain error coins and varieties can be quite valuable. These rarities are what many collectors actively seek, and finding one could mean your 1993 penny is worth significantly more than one cent.

![A 1993 penny showing a potential doubling error on the lettering](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1993-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1993-penny-worth-image-4_8M2wsFain.png)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1993 Close AM Variety" level="3" >}}
One of the most valuable 1993 penny varieties is the "Close AM" error. On standard 1993 pennies, there is a space between the A and M in "AMERICA" on the reverse side. However, on the rare Close AM variety, these letters are positioned closer together or even touching. This variety is particularly valuable for 1993 Philadelphia (no mint mark) pennies.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1993 Close AM Penny Values" description="Current market values based on condition" >}}
<tr>
<td>1993 Close AM (Circulated)</td>
<td>$50-$250</td>
<td>Depending on condition</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1993 Close AM (Uncirculated)</td>
<td>$500-$1,500</td>
<td>MS60-MS63 grades</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1993 Close AM (Gem)</td>
<td>$2,000-$5,000</td>
<td>MS64+ grades</td>
</tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

According to eBay listings like [this one](https://www.ebay.com/itm/266422457533), the Close AM error is considered rare and significantly affects the value of a 1993 penny, making it a prized find for error coin collectors.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Double Die Errors" level="3" >}}
Double die errors occur during the minting process when the die used to strike the coin receives multiple impressions at slightly different angles. This results in a doubling effect visible on certain parts of the coin. While not as famous as the 1955 or 1969 doubled die cents, some 1993 pennies exhibit minor doubling that can increase their value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1993 Double Die Penny Values" description="Current market values based on severity of doubling" >}}
<tr>
<td>Minor Doubling</td>
<td>$5-$20</td>
<td>Slight doubling visible under magnification</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Moderate Doubling</td>
<td>$20-$100</td>
<td>Doubling visible to the naked eye</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Major Doubling</td>
<td>$100-$500+</td>
<td>Significant doubling on date or lettering</td>
</tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Other 1993 Penny Errors" level="3" >}}
Various other minting errors can significantly increase the value of a 1993 penny. These include off-center strikes, die cracks, lamination errors, and more. The value depends on the severity and visual appeal of the error.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

{{< data-modules/price-table title="Other 1993 Penny Error Values" description="Current market values based on error type" >}}
<tr>
<td>Off-Center Strike (25-50%)</td>
<td>$10-$50</td>
<td>Value increases with percentage off-center</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Off-Center Strike (50%+)</td>
<td>$50-$150</td>
<td>With date visible</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Die Cracks/Breaks</td>
<td>$5-$30</td>
<td>Depending on size and location</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lamination Error</td>
<td>$5-$30</td>

## Selling and Preserving Your 1993 Pennies

If you've discovered a potentially valuable 1993 penny, you'll want to know how to properly preserve it and potentially sell it for its maximum value.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Proper Storage and Handling" level="3" >}}
Proper storage is crucial to maintaining your coin's condition and value. Never clean your coins, as this can significantly reduce their value. Instead, handle them by the edges and store them in protective holders.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

{{< interactive-modules/condition-checklist title="1993 Penny Preservation Tips" description="Follow these guidelines to maintain your coin's condition" >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Handle coins only by their edges" / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Store in non-PVC coin flips, holders, or albums" / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Keep coins in a cool, dry environment" / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Never clean coins with chemicals or abrasives" / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Consider professional grading for valuable specimens" / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Protect from exposure to air, moisture, and sulfur" / />}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Professional Grading" level="3" >}}
For potentially valuable 1993 pennies, especially those with errors or in uncirculated condition, professional grading is recommended. Companies like PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) and NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation) authenticate and grade coins on a scale from 1 to 70, with 70 being perfect. A graded coin often sells for more than an ungraded one of similar quality.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

According to [PCGS CoinFacts](https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1993-1c-rd/3107), professionally graded 1993 cents have established auction records that can guide expectations for similar coins.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Selling Options" level="3" >}}
If you have a valuable 1993 penny, you have several options for selling it:
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

1. **Coin Dealers**: Local or online coin dealers can offer immediate payment, though typically less than retail value.
2. **Coin Shows**: These events bring together dealers and collectors, potentially resulting in better prices.
3. **Online Auctions**: Platforms like eBay can reach many collectors, but require attention to proper listing details and shipping.
4. **Coin Forums**: Specialized forums like CoinTalk or Reddit's r/Coins can connect you with knowledgeable collectors.
5. **Auction Houses**: For extremely valuable coins (generally $500+), traditional auction houses might be appropriate.

## FAQs About 1993 Penny Values

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About 1993 Penny Values" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a regular 1993 penny worth?" >}}
    A regular 1993 penny in circulated condition is generally worth only its face value of one cent. Even in uncirculated condition, most 1993 pennies are worth between $0.25 and $1 unless they're in pristine condition (MS67 or higher) or have valuable errors.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes a 1993 penny valuable?" >}}
    Several factors can make a 1993 penny valuable:
    
    - Pristine uncirculated condition (MS67 or higher)
    - The Close AM variety (letters A and M in AMERICA are close or touching)
    - Double die errors causing visible doubling
    - Off-center strikes and other minting errors
    - Being a proof coin (S mint mark)
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I know if I have a 1993 Close AM penny?" >}}
    To identify a 1993 Close AM penny, examine the word "AMERICA" on the reverse side using a magnifying glass. On a normal 1993 penny, there's a visible gap between the A and M. On the valuable Close AM variety, these letters are positioned very close together or even touching. This variety is most valuable on Philadelphia-minted pennies (those with no mint mark).
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the most valuable 1993 penny ever sold?" >}}
    The most valuable 1993 pennies are the MS69 specimens of the Philadelphia (no mint mark) issue, which have sold for nearly $5,000. For error coins, the 1993 Close AM variety in high grades can sell for $2,000-$5,000. These premium prices are extremely rare and represent the absolute finest known examples.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are 1993-D pennies worth anything?" >}}
    Like their Philadelphia counterparts, most 1993-D pennies in circulation are worth only face value (one cent). Uncirculated examples typically range from $0.25 to $10 depending on their condition, with pristine MS67+ examples potentially worth $50-$100. The 1993-D penny generally isn't known for valuable errors like the Close AM variety found on the Philadelphia coins.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my 1993 penny is uncirculated?" >}}
    An uncirculated 1993 penny will show no signs of wear on its high points. Lincoln's hair and ear details will be sharp, not flattened. The coin will typically have its original mint luster, appearing somewhat shiny or satiny, and may be copper-red, reddish-brown, or brown depending on how it has toned over time. Any marks present will be from the minting and handling process, not from circulation wear.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Should I clean my 1993 penny to make it more valuable?" >}}
    Absolutely not! Cleaning a coin, even gently, damages its original surface and can significantly reduce its value to collectors. Cleaned coins are easily identified by experts and typically sell for much less than coins with original surfaces, even if those original surfaces have naturally darkened over time. If you have a potentially valuable 1993 penny, keep it in its original condition.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are there any other valuable pennies from the 1990s I should look for?" >}}
    Yes, there are several other valuable pennies from the 1990s:
    
    - 1992 Close AM penny (similar to the 1993 variety)
    - 1995 Doubled Die Obverse penny
    - 1998, 1999 Wide AM penny
    - 1999-S Proof 9 cent (with a mintmark that appears to be an upside-down 9)
    
    Like the 1993 penny, these are all worth checking for in your change or collection.

## Conclusion

While the vast majority of 1993 pennies are worth only their face value of one cent, certain specimens can be quite valuable to collectors. The most valuable 1993 pennies include those in pristine uncirculated condition (MS67 or higher), the rare Close AM variety, and those with significant minting errors.

If you think you might have a valuable 1993 penny, take the time to examine it carefully using a magnifying glass. Look for the tell-tale signs of the Close AM variety, any doubling on the lettering or date, and assess its overall condition. For potentially valuable coins, consider getting them professionally authenticated and graded.

Remember that coin collecting is not just about monetary value—it's also about the joy of discovery and the appreciation of numismatic history. Whether your 1993 penny is worth one cent or several thousand dollars, it represents a tangible piece of American coinage history that you can hold in your hand.
