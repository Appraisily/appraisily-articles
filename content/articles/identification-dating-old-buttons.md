Buttons are more than just functional fasteners – they're miniature works of art that tell stories of fashion, technology, and social history. For collectors and enthusiasts, these small treasures offer a tangible connection to the past. Whether you've inherited a jar of old buttons, discovered them while metal detecting, or are building a serious collection, knowing how to properly identify and date buttons is essential for determining their historical significance and value.

![Collection of antique and vintage buttons showing various materials and designs](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/identification-dating-old-buttons/identification-dating-old-buttons-image-1_e_9eVYfxc.png)

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key characteristics that help determine a button's age, material, origin, and potential value. From ancient bone buttons to ornate Victorian masterpieces to mid-century modern designs, you'll learn to recognize the telltale signs that distinguish truly valuable specimens from everyday fasteners.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Why Button Identification Matters" level="2" >}}
Understanding how to properly identify and date buttons provides crucial context for collectors, historians, archaeologists, and fashion enthusiasts.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Button identification isn't just about satisfying curiosity – it's fundamental to understanding their historical and monetary value. As noted by [Agnes' Vintage World](http://agnesvintageworld.blogspot.com/p/button-identification.html), "Button identification is crucial to its dating. The state of the buttons can be misleading, as the colour can be very well preserved." Without proper identification skills, you might miss a rare treasure or misattribute a button's age and significance.

Accurate identification allows you to:

1. Determine appropriate conservation methods
2. Authenticate period clothing and artifacts
3. Establish fair market values for buying, selling, or insurance
4. Contribute to historical research and documentation
5. Create more meaningful and valuable collections

For metal detectorists, button identification can provide critical dating evidence for archaeological sites. According to the [Friendly Metal Detecting Forum](https://metaldetectingforum.com/index.php?threads/identifying-buttons.290827/), "There are some websites that link to some old button manufacturers info can be found online" that can help place buttons in their proper historical context.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Identifying Button Materials" level="2" >}}
The material of a button is often the first clue to its age, origin, and value. Different materials were popular during specific historical periods.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Metal Buttons

Metal buttons have been produced for centuries, with materials ranging from precious metals to alloys. Here's how to identify common metal button types:

**Brass Buttons:** Popular from the 18th to early 20th centuries, especially for military and uniform buttons. Early brass buttons often have a warmer, more golden tone than modern examples. According to [HobbyLark](https://hobbylark.com/collecting/Vintage-Button-Guide-Ways-to-Indentify-Antique-Buttons), "One way is to look at the material in or around the shank or buttonholes. You can sometimes see unprocessed materials in or around these holes."

**Copper Buttons:** Often used for utilitarian purposes, these buttons develop a distinctive green patina over time.

**Silver and Gold Buttons:** Typically found on high-end garments and can be hallmarked. Look for quality marks or stamps indicating silver content (sterling, 800, 925, etc.).

**Pewter Buttons:** Common in the 18th and early 19th centuries, these soft metal buttons have a dull gray appearance and often show significant wear.

### Shell Buttons

**Mother of Pearl:** These iridescent buttons made from mollusk shells have been popular since the 18th century and remain desirable today. As noted in the research on [identifying vintage mother of pearl buttons](https://tissura.com/articles/mother-of-pearl-buttons), "Mother of pearl buttons have more depth of color than plastic buttons. It takes a look to tell them from any other buttons due to their noble opalescent sheen."

**Pearl Shell:** Similar to mother of pearl but with less iridescence.

**Abalone:** Features distinctive blue-green-purple shimmer.

### Natural Material Buttons

**Bone and Horn:** Used since ancient times, these buttons can be distinguished by their natural grain patterns and warm coloration.

**Vegetable Ivory (Tagua Nut):** Popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, these plant-based buttons resemble ivory but are more sustainable.

**Wood:** Varies widely in appearance based on the type of wood used and any applied finishes.

### Early Synthetic Materials

**Bakelite:** The first fully synthetic plastic, popular from the 1920s-1940s. According to [Va-Voom Vintage](http://www.vavoomvintage.net/2012/03/how-to-identify-bakelite.html), you can identify Bakelite by warming it with friction: "Rub the piece with your thumb until it becomes warm and give it a sniff. If it is Bakelite, it will give off the chemical scent of formaldehyde."

**Celluloid:** An early plastic used from the 1870s to the 1930s that can become brittle and yellowed with age.

**Lucite:** A clearer acrylic plastic popular from the 1940s onward.

**Casein (Galalith):** A milk-based plastic popular in Art Deco designs from the 1900s-1930s.

### Ceramic and Glass Buttons

**Porcelain/China:** Often hand-painted with delicate designs, popular in the 19th century.

**Prosser Buttons:** Machine-made ceramic buttons with a distinctive seam around the edge and often a dimpled back. According to the [DAACS Cataloging Manual](https://www.daacs.org/wp-content/uploads/buttons.pdf), Prosser buttons "Generally date after 1840."

**Glass:** Available in various colors and styles, from simple utilitarian buttons to elaborate Victorian designs.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Dating Buttons by Construction Methods" level="2" >}}
The way a button is manufactured provides crucial clues about its age and origin.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Button Shanks and Attachments

The shank (attachment method) of a button is one of the most reliable indicators of its age. According to [Scott Clark's dating guide](https://www.detecting.us/dating-and-identification-of-metal-detecting-finds/dating-buttons-by-shank-style-and-material/), button shanks evolved significantly over time:

**Alpha-style shank:** Cast as part of the button, used primarily before 1800.

**Omega-style shank:** Wire loop shaped like the Greek letter omega, common from approximately 1800-1860.

**Eye and wire shank:** Wire shank inserted through an eye cast as part of the button, used mid-19th century.

**Sanders-type shank:** Self-shank with a bar across the back, popular in the late 19th century.

**Sew-through buttons:** These have holes rather than shanks and their pattern (2-hole or 4-hole) and spacing can help with dating.

![Various button shank styles from different time periods](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/identification-dating-old-buttons/identification-dating-old-buttons-image-3_5eJOpmthz.png)

### Manufacturing Techniques

**Hand-crafted buttons:** Look for slight irregularities in shape, inconsistent thickness, or uneven hole placement. As noted by [LoveToKnow](https://www.lovetoknow.com/home/antiques-collectibles/identifying-rare-valuable-antique-buttons), antique buttons often "show signs of being handmade, such as a lack of uniformity."

**Die-struck buttons:** Common in military and uniform buttons from the early 19th century onward.

**Molded buttons:** Became increasingly common with the advent of plastic materials in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

**Fabric-covered buttons:** The construction of the back and the covering method can indicate age.

**Prosser process:** Used for ceramic buttons after 1840, creating a distinctive "china" button with a slightly pitted bottom surface.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Key Identification Features" level="2" >}}
Beyond material and construction, there are several other important features that help date and identify old buttons.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Backmarks and Maker's Marks

Backmarks are text, symbols, or logos stamped into the back of a button. According to the [Friendly Metal Detecting Forum](https://metaldetectingforum.com/index.php?threads/button-date.293518/), "The first backmarked flatbuttons had the backmark written in raised lettering. They start showing up in Britain 'about' 1790, perhaps a few years earlier."

Common backmarks include:

- Manufacturer's name or initials
- Quality marks indicating material composition
- Patent dates (remember these indicate when the manufacturing process was patented, not necessarily when the button was made)
- Country of origin (Note: "Made in..." markings were generally required after 1891)

### Design and Artistic Style

Buttons often reflect the artistic movements of their time:

**Georgian Period (1714-1837):** Simple designs, often with geometric patterns.

**Victorian Era (1837-1901):** Elaborate designs, including picture buttons portraying scenes, animals, people, and motifs from nature.

**Art Nouveau (1890-1910):** Flowing, natural forms and asymmetrical designs.

**Art Deco (1920s-1930s):** Bold geometric patterns and stylized forms.

**Mid-Century Modern (1940s-1960s):** Clean lines, atomic and starburst patterns, bold colors.

### Size and Shape

Button size and shape evolved over time:

- 18th-century buttons tended to be smaller
- Victorian buttons came in various sizes, with large statement buttons becoming popular
- Early 20th-century buttons often featured simpler, more standardized designs
- Unusual shapes (animals, flowers, etc.) were particularly popular during the Victorian and Art Deco periods

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Specialized Button Types" level="2" >}}
Certain button categories have their own unique identification characteristics and historical significance.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Military Buttons

Military buttons are among the most collected and studied types. They typically feature:

- Regimental insignia or national emblems
- Specific attachment methods that evolved over time
- Maker's marks that can help determine age and authenticity

Military buttons can be dated by researching the specific regiment, division, or branch indicated by their design. Resources from military museums and reference books like ["Uniform Buttons of the United States"](https://www.amazon.com/Uniform-Buttons-United-States-1776-1865/dp/0917218914) can help with identification.

### Picture Buttons

Popular primarily during the Victorian era (1837-1901), picture buttons feature miniature scenes or images:

- Themes include mythology, literature, history, animals, and everyday life
- Often made of brass with steel cuts or decorative finishes
- Some were hand-painted on porcelain
- Matching sets are particularly valuable

### Livery Buttons

Used on the uniforms of household staff for wealthy families:

- Feature family crests, coats of arms, or emblems
- Can be researched through heraldic records
- Often made of brass or silver-plated brass
- Sizes varied based on placement (larger for coats, smaller for vests)

### Specialized Collecting Categories

Many collectors focus on specific button categories:

- **Realistics:** Buttons shaped like objects (animals, plants, etc.)
- **Satsuma:** Japanese porcelain buttons with hand-painted designs
- **Sporting buttons:** Featuring hunting, fishing, or other sports motifs
- **Black glass:** Popular mourning buttons from the Victorian era
- **Jewel buttons:** Featuring cut steel, rhinestones, or other gem-like elements

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Button Identification and Dating" id="button-faq" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do you identify old flat buttons?" >}}
    Flat button identification, particularly for vintage colonial metal buttons, can be done by examining the back seam. According to research from [The King's Bay](https://thekingsbay.com/flat-button-vintage-colonial-metal-buttons-identification/), "Flat button vintage colonial metal button identification can easily be done from the back by looking at the seam." 
    
    Military, political, or official buttons from this time period might have a rim or a center formed around a pin. Other identification factors include:
    
    - Material composition (brass, copper, pewter, etc.)
    - Presence and style of backmarks
    - Attachment method (alpha shank, omega shank, etc.)
    - Design elements that reflect period-specific styles
    - Signs of hand-crafting vs. machine production
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How to tell if buttons are Bakelite?" >}}
    Bakelite buttons, popular from the 1920s through the 1940s, can be identified through several testing methods:
    
    1. **Hot water test**: Bakelite has a distinctive formaldehyde smell when placed in hot water.
    
    2. **Friction test**: As described by [Va-Voom Vintage](http://www.vavoomvintage.net/2012/03/how-to-identify-bakelite.html), "Rub the piece with your thumb until it becomes warm and give it a sniff. If it is Bakelite, it will give off the chemical scent of formaldehyde."
    
    3. **Formula 409 test**: A cotton swab with Formula 409 cleaner rubbed on Bakelite will turn yellow.
    
    4. **Hot pin test**: A heated pin touched to an inconspicuous spot will not melt Bakelite but might produce the characteristic smell.
    
    Visually, Bakelite buttons often have a rich, deep color that doesn't fade, may show an attractive patina, and feel heavier than other plastic buttons.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How to identify vintage mother of pearl buttons?" >}}
    Mother of pearl buttons have distinctive characteristics that separate them from plastic imitations:
    
    1. **Depth of color**: According to [Tissura](https://tissura.com/articles/mother-of-pearl-buttons), "Mother of pearl buttons have more depth of color than plastic buttons. It takes a look to tell them from any other buttons due to their noble opalescent sheen."
    
    2. **Temperature**: Mother of pearl feels cool to the touch initially, while plastic warms quickly.
    
    3. **Light test**: When held up to light, genuine mother of pearl has a translucent quality with natural variations.
    
    4. **Weight**: Mother of pearl is typically heavier than plastic imitations.
    
    5. **Edge examination**: Under magnification, you can often see the layered structure of the shell material.
    
    6. **Sound test**: When tapped against teeth or glass, mother of pearl makes a distinctive solid clicking sound compared to plastic.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
