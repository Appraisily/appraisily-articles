{{< content-modules/section-header title="Introduction to 1964 Jefferson Nickels" level="2" >}}
The 1964 Jefferson nickel holds a special place in American numismatics as one of the last coins produced before significant changes to U.S. coinage composition. While many 1964 nickels are worth only face value, certain specimens can command impressive premiums in the collector market. This guide will help you understand what makes a 1964 nickel valuable and how to identify if you have a coin worth more than five cents.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1964 Nickel Varieties and Mint Marks" level="2" >}}
The United States Mint produced Jefferson nickels at two facilities in 1964, resulting in distinct varieties that collectors seek. Understanding these varieties is key to accurately valuing your coin.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

{{< visual-modules/timeline title="1964 Nickel Production History" >}}
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="Early 1964" title="Philadelphia Mint Production" >}}
    The Philadelphia Mint produced 1,028,622,762 nickels in 1964 with no mint mark.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1964" title="Denver Mint Production" >}}
    The Denver Mint struck 1,787,297,160 nickels in 1964, marked with a small "D" mint mark.

### Philadelphia Mint (No Mint Mark)

The Philadelphia Mint produced over 1 billion Jefferson nickels in 1964, making them relatively common. These coins have no mint mark and typically command only a small premium over face value unless in exceptional condition.

### Denver Mint (D Mint Mark)

The Denver Mint struck nearly 1.8 billion nickels in 1964, identifiable by a small "D" mint mark on the reverse side, below Monticello. To locate the mint mark, look on the reverse side of the coin, just to the right of Monticello. The mint mark appears as a small letter.

![Close-up of the mint mark location on a 1964-D Jefferson nickel](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-nickel-from-1964-worth/how-much-is-a-nickel-from-1964-worth-image-3_jcEAoEXFT.png)

As noted by [Coin Value Checker](https://www.coinvaluechecker.com/how-much-is-a-1964-nickel-worth/), the 1964-D nickel typically has the same value range as the Philadelphia version in comparable grades.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="What Makes a 1964 Nickel Valuable?" level="2" >}}
While most 1964 nickels are worth only a few cents over face value, certain factors can dramatically increase their worth to collectors and investors. Understanding these value-adding features can help you identify potentially valuable specimens.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Full Steps Designation (FS)

One of the most significant value-adding features of Jefferson nickels is the "Full Steps" designation, which refers to the clarity of the steps on Monticello on the reverse side. Most 1964 nickels have worn or poorly struck steps, but specimens with clearly defined steps command significant premiums.

{{< interactive-modules/condition-checklist title="Full Steps Requirements" description="Check these characteristics to identify a Full Steps nickel" >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Complete separation of steps visible" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="No merging of step lines" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Sharp strike with clear definition" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Minimal wear on high points" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="5FS: Five full steps visible" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="6FS: Six full steps visible (most valuable)" / / />}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

According to the NGC Price Guide, 1964 Jefferson nickels with a 5FS or 6FS designation can be worth between $20 and $15,000, depending on their overall grade. The rarity of well-struck steps makes these specimens particularly desirable to collectors.

### Special Strike Specimens

The 1964 Special Strike Jefferson nickels are exceptionally rare and valuable coins. These are neither regular circulation strikes nor standard proofs, but special specimens with distinctive characteristics.

{{< interactive-modules/condition-checklist title="Special Strike Characteristics" description="Features that identify a 1964 Special Strike nickel" >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Extremely sharp strike and detail" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Sharp, square edge rims" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Satin-like surface appearance" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Often exhibits full steps on Monticello" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Superior quality compared to business strikes" / / />}}


As reported by [PCGS CoinFacts](https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1964-5c-sms/4170), 1964 Special Strike nickels are highly sought-after by collectors and can command substantial premiums in the market.

![A high-grade 1964 Special Strike Jefferson nickel with distinctive satin finish](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-nickel-from-1964-worth/how-much-is-a-nickel-from-1964-worth-image-4_rk_rk2h4M.png)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Valuable 1964 Nickel Errors" level="2" >}}
Error coins are among the most valuable in numismatics, and the 1964 Jefferson nickel is no exception. Several notable errors can significantly increase the value of these otherwise common coins.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Double Die Errors

Double die errors occur when the die used to strike the coin is itself doubled during the hub-and-die creation process. This results in a doubled image in parts of the design. On 1964 nickels, look for doubling in the lettering, date, or Jefferson's features.

### Off-Center Strikes

Off-center strikes happen when the coin blank is not properly centered between the dies during striking. These errors are valued based on how far off-center they are and whether the date is still visible. A 1964 nickel that is 50% off-center but still shows the complete date can be worth $50-$100 or more.

### Wrong Planchet Errors

One of the rarest and most valuable errors is a wrong planchet error, where a 1964 nickel design is struck on a planchet intended for another denomination. For example, a 1964 nickel struck on a cent planchet or a silver dime planchet could be worth thousands of dollars.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How to Identify Valuable 1964 Nickels" level="2" >}}
If you're examining your own 1964 nickels to determine if they might be valuable, follow these steps for a thorough assessment.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Grading Your 1964 Nickel

The condition or grade of your coin is one of the most important factors in determining its value. Professional coin grading uses the Sheldon Scale, which ranges from Poor (P-1) to Perfect Mint State (MS-70).

{{< interactive-modules/condition-checklist title="Grading Checklist for 1964 Nickels" description="Use these criteria to assess your coin's condition" >}}
  
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}
{{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Check for wear on high points (Jefferson's hair, cheek, Monticello roof)" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Examine the luster and shininess of the coin" / / />}}

  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Look at the edge of the coin for any damage" / / />}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### Magnified Examination for Errors

Use a magnifying glass or coin loupe (10x magnification is ideal) to closely examine your coin for valuable errors:

1. **Check for doubling**: Look at the lettering, date, and Jefferson's features for signs of doubling
2. **Examine the mint mark**: For D-mint coins, check if the mint mark shows signs of being punched multiple times or in different positions
3. **Look for die cracks**: These appear as raised lines on the coin's surface
4. **Check for rotated dies**: The reverse should be properly aligned with the obverse—any rotation could indicate an error

### The Full Steps Test

To determine if your 1964 nickel has the valuable Full Steps designation:

1. Hold the coin under good lighting
2. Use magnification to examine the steps on Monticello
3. Count how many distinct, separated steps you can see
4. For 5FS designation, five complete steps must be visible
5. For the more valuable 6FS designation, all six steps must be clearly defined and separated

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Is My 1964 Nickel Silver?" level="2" >}}
A common misconception about 1964 nickels is that they might contain silver. Let's clarify this important point for collectors.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Despite coming from an era when many U.S. coins did contain silver, **1964 Jefferson nickels are NOT made of silver**. They have the standard composition of 75% copper and 25% nickel that was used for Jefferson nickels from 1946 through the present day (except for wartime silver nickels from 1942-1945).

The confusion may arise because 1964 was the last year that dimes and quarters were made with 90% silver content before transitioning to clad copper-nickel composition in 1965. However, the nickel denomination had already returned to its copper-nickel composition back in 1946 after the end of World War II.

The only silver Jefferson nickels were the "War Nickels" produced from mid-1942 through 1945, which contained 35% silver. These can be identified by the large mint mark above Monticello.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About 1964 Nickels" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I know if my 1964 nickel is valuable?" >}}
    In circulated condition, a 1964 nickel is typically worth just $0.10 to $0.20. However, your 1964 nickel could be valuable if it:

    - Is in uncirculated (mint state) condition with no wear
    - Shows "Full Steps" on the Monticello building
    - Is a Special Strike specimen with a satin-like finish
    - Has visible errors like doubling, off-center strikes, or wrong planchet
    - Is graded MS67 or higher by a professional grading service

    The most valuable 1964 nickels are those with the Full Steps designation in high mint state grades (MS65+) or with significant errors.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where is the mint mark on a 1964 nickel?" >}}
    On 1964 Jefferson nickels, the mint mark (if present) is located on the reverse side of the coin, to the right of Monticello. Only coins produced at the Denver Mint will have a mint mark, appearing as a small "D." Nickels produced at the Philadelphia Mint in 1964 have no mint mark.

    Don't confuse 1964 nickels with War Nickels (1942-1945), which have the mint mark positioned above Monticello.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my 1964 nickel has Full Steps?" >}}
    To identify if your 1964 nickel has the valuable Full Steps designation:

    1. Use a magnifying glass or coin loupe (10x magnification is ideal)
    2. Look at the steps of Monticello on the reverse side
    3. Check for clear, distinct separation between each step
    4. Count how many complete steps are visible
    5. For 5FS designation, five complete steps must be visible
    6. For the more valuable 6FS designation, all six steps must be clearly defined

    Full Steps nickels are rare because the steps area was often poorly struck or quickly wore down during circulation.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are there any rare 1964 nickel errors I should look for?" >}}
    Yes, several valuable error types can appear on 1964 nickels:

    - Double Die errors: Look for doubling on lettering, date, or Jefferson's features
    - Off-Center strikes: The design is not centered on the coin
    - Wrong planchet errors: 1964 nickel design struck on a planchet meant for another denomination
    - Die cracks: Raised lines appearing on the coin's surface
    - Repunched mint marks: The D mint mark shows signs of being punched multiple times
    - Rotated dies: The reverse is not properly aligned with the obverse

    The most valuable errors can be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can you tell if a 1964 nickel is a Special Strike?" >}}
    The 1964 Special Strike Jefferson nickels have several distinctive characteristics:

    - Extremely sharp strike with exceptional detail
    - Sharp, square edge rims unlike business strikes
    - Satin-like surface appearance that differs from both circulation coins and regular proofs
    - Often exhibits full steps on Monticello
    - Superior overall quality
    
    These Special Strike nickels are quite rare and valuable. The most reliable way to confirm a Special Strike is through professional authentication by PCGS or NGC.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is a 1964 nickel made of silver?" >}}
    No, 1964 Jefferson nickels are not made of silver. They have the standard composition of 75% copper and 25% nickel, the same as most Jefferson nickels from 1946 to present day.

    The confusion might arise because 1964 was the last year that dimes and quarters contained 90% silver. The only silver Jefferson nickels were the "War Nickels" produced from mid-1942 through 1945, which contained 35% silver and can be identified by the large mint mark above Monticello.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Should I clean my 1964 nickel to see if it's valuable?" >}}
    No, you should never clean any coin, including 1964 nickels, if you're interested in their collector value. Cleaning a coin, even gently, damages the original surface and can significantly reduce its value to collectors. Professional numismatists can easily detect cleaned coins, and such coins typically receive lower grades and valuations.

    If you want to examine your coin more clearly, use good lighting and magnification instead of attempting to clean it.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What's the most expensive 1964 nickel ever sold?" >}}
    The most expensive 1964 Jefferson nickels are typically Special Strike specimens with the Full Steps designation in top grades (MS67+). These coins have sold for $10,000-$15,000 or more at major auctions.

    In September 2022, a 1964 nickel with no mint mark, certified by PCGS as Genuine, sold for $9,700 on eBay, demonstrating that exceptional specimens can command remarkable prices.

If you believe you have a valuable 1964 nickel, consider these options for selling or getting it professionally appraised.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Professional Grading Services

Before selling a potentially valuable 1964 nickel, consider having it authenticated and graded by a professional grading service. The two most reputable services are:

### Selling Options

If you have a valuable 1964 nickel, consider these selling venues:

1. **Coin Dealers**: Local coin shops or dealers at coin shows can offer immediate payment, though possibly below maximum market value
2. **Auction Houses**: Major auction houses like Heritage Auctions or Stack's Bowers specialize in numismatics and can help reach serious collectors
3. **Online Marketplaces**: eBay, Heritage Auctions online, or specialized coin forums
4. **Direct to Collectors**: Coin collector clubs or online communities like the American Numismatic Association

Remember that especially valuable coins (worth hundreds or thousands) typically sell best through auctions or to specialized dealers who understand their true value.

While most 1964 Jefferson nickels are indeed worth only a few cents over face value, certain specimens can be surprisingly valuable. The key to determining if your coin is worth keeping lies in understanding what makes these coins valuable to collectors.

The most important factors affecting a 1964 nickel's value are:

1. **Condition**: Uncirculated specimens, particularly those in grades MS65 and above, can be worth from $15 to $500 or more
2. **Full Steps**: Nickels with clear, complete steps on Monticello can be worth from $20 to $15,000 depending on grade
3. **Special Strike**: The rare satin-finish special strike specimens can command thousands of dollars
4. **Errors**: Double dies, off-center strikes, and wrong planchet errors can be extremely valuable
5. **Professional Certification**: Coins graded and authenticated by PCGS or NGC typically command higher prices than ungraded specimens

Even if most of your 1964 nickels turn out to be worth only face value, the thrill of the hunt and the possibility of finding a rare variety or error make searching through them a rewarding hobby. Remember that coin collecting is as much about the joy of discovery and learning as it is about monetary value.

The next time you come across a 1964 Jefferson nickel in your change or collection, take a closer look—you might just be holding a coin worth far more than its humble five-cent face value.
