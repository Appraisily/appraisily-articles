Cartier boutiques offer assessment services that can provide valuable insights into your timepiece. While they may not offer formal appraisals for insurance or resale purposes, their expertise is unmatched for authentication.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

According to the [official Cartier website](https://www.cartier.com/en-it/services/request-service/exchange-your-watch), their sales associates can provide pre-valuation quotes and assist with the exchange of your watch for a new Cartier timepiece.

Understanding which Cartier models tend to retain or appreciate in value can help guide investment decisions and set appropriate expectations during the appraisal process.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

According to [The Luxury Hut](https://www.theluxuryhut.com/blog/is-cartier-watch-a-good-investment-and-holding-value/), vintage Cartier watches have a strong reputation for holding value in the secondary market. However, not all models perform equally well.

{{< data-modules/price-table title="Cartier Models with Strong Value Retention" description="Models known for maintaining or appreciating in value" >}}
<tr>
  <td>Cartier Tank Louis</td>
  <td>Excellent</td>
  <td>Gold versions especially valuable; vintage models appreciate</td>

  <td>Very Good</td>
  <td>Original designs and limited editions perform best</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Cartier Crash</td>
  <td>Outstanding</td>
  <td>Rare model with significant appreciation potential</td>

According to [Watches Guild](https://www.watchesguild.com/articles/cartier-holding-value), at full retail price, only select Cartier models hold their value well. Historically, the Cartier Tank and Santos gold models fare best over time.

A [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cartier/comments/1hbwnuo/do_cartier_watches_hold_their_value/) on r/Cartier suggests that limited edition models tend to hold value better than standard production pieces that can be readily purchased at boutiques.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Preparing Your Cartier Watch for Appraisal" level="2" >}}
Taking specific steps before submitting your Cartier watch for appraisal can help ensure you receive the most accurate valuation possible.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}
