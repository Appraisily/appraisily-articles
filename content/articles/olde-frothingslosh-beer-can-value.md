{{< content-modules/section-header title="Introduction to Olde Frothingslosh" level="2" >}}
Olde Frothingslosh, advertised as "the pale stale ale with the foam on the bottom," represents one of the most beloved beer can collectibles in the breweriana world. What began as a radio joke in the 1950s by Pittsburgh radio personality Rege Cordic evolved into a real holiday beer produced by Pittsburgh Brewing Company, creating an enduring legacy of collectible cans that continue to captivate collectors decades later.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Vintage Olde Frothingslosh beer can with Pittsburgh Brewing Company logo and "Pale Stale Ale" slogan](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/olde-frothingslosh-beer-can-value/olde-frothingslosh-beer-can-value-image-1_dmNWGBszs.png)

Olde Frothingslosh is unique in the brewing world â€“ a fictional beer that became real. The humorous concept of "foam on the bottom" and the fictional Sir Reginald Frothingslosh character made these seasonal releases especially popular during the holiday seasons from the 1950s through today. For collectors, these cans represent not just brewing history but also a piece of Pittsburgh cultural heritage.

The value of Olde Frothingslosh cans varies significantly based on several factors, including the year of production, condition, rarity, and specific design variations. With renewed interest in breweriana collecting, these distinctive cans have seen increasing demand in recent years.

The unique history of Olde Frothingslosh makes its cans particularly valuable to collectors. As a product that began as fiction and became reality, these cans tell the story of Pittsburgh's brewing heritage and humor, combining local culture with beer memorabilia in a way few other collectibles can match.

According to the [Rusty Cans historical archive](https://www.rustycans.com/HISTORY/oldfroth.html), the 1955 original Olde Frothingslosh can is among the most sought-after beer cans for serious collectors, with prices reflecting its historical significance and rarity.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Most Valuable Olde Frothingslosh Cans" level="2" >}}
While all Olde Frothingslosh cans hold some collector value, certain editions stand out for their exceptional worth in today's market. These premium collectibles represent the high end of what collectors might expect to pay or receive.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The 1955 original can commands the highest premium due to its historical significance as the first actual production of what had previously been only a radio joke. These cans represent the birth of the Olde Frothingslosh phenomenon and are increasingly difficult to find in excellent condition.

According to a [Reddit thread in the breweriana community](https://www.reddit.com/r/breweriana/comments/10nsiln/i_have_a_69_olde_frothingslosh_unopened_can_and/), unopened cans from the late 1960s are becoming exceedingly rare, with collectors noting that "there is nothing right now on the market that is an unopened can," potentially allowing sellers to set higher price points for these pristine specimens.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors Affecting Olde Frothingslosh Can Values" level="2" >}}
The market value of Olde Frothingslosh beer cans varies significantly based on several key factors. Understanding these elements can help collectors accurately assess the worth of their breweriana items.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Condition Assessment

The condition of a beer can is perhaps the single most important factor in determining its value. For Olde Frothingslosh cans, condition becomes even more critical due to their age and the changing materials used over the decades.

{{< interactive-modules/condition-checklist title="Olde Frothingslosh Condition Assessment" description="Check applicable items to gauge the condition of your can" >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="No rust spots or oxidation" /  >}}

  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Original shine maintained" /  >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="No scratches or paint loss" /  >}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### Production Year and Rarity

The year a particular Olde Frothingslosh can was produced significantly impacts its value. According to information from [CanSmart Beer Cans & Breweriana](https://cansmartbeercans.com/are-my-cans-valuable%3F), cans with flat tops, zip tabs, fan tabs, or juice tabs have inherent value, with older cans typically commanding higher prices.

For Olde Frothingslosh specifically:
- 1950s cans (especially the original 1955 release) are the most valuable
- 1960s Miss Olde Frothingslosh cans follow in value
- 1970s-1980s holiday editions have moderate collectible value
- Modern releases (including the 2024 revival) currently have lower secondary market value but will likely appreciate over time

### Opening Method and Material

The method used to open the can and the material it's made from affects value:

- Early flat-top cans requiring a can opener are more valuable
- Pull-tab cans from the 1960s-70s hold moderate value
- Steel cans are generally worth more than aluminum versions
- Heavier gauge metal cans (pre-1970s) command premium prices
- Modern stay-on-tab aluminum cans have the lowest collector value

According to [Breweriana.com's dating guide](https://www.breweriana.com/beer-can-appraisal/how-to-date-cans.html), the weight and gauge of metal can help determine a can's age, with older, heavier cans typically being more valuable to collectors.

### Special Editions and Complete Sets

Certain Olde Frothingslosh releases have additional collectible value:

- Complete sets (like the Sir Reggie 4-color set listed on [Bill's Beer Cans](https://www.billsbeercans.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=14_33)) often sell for more than individual cans
- Anniversary editions (such as the 30 Years can sold by [Sam's Man Cave](https://www.samsmancave.com/Beer-Cans/Old-Frothingslosh-30-Years-Beer-Can)) have commemorative value
- Miss Olde Frothingslosh beauty contest cans featuring Fatima Yechburgh carry premium value due to their cultural significance and the story behind model Marsha Phillips, as detailed on [Beer Info](https://beerinfo.com/the-story-of-miss-olde-frothingslosh-marsha-phillips/)
- Unopened cans with original contents intact can sell for 2-5 times the value of empty examples

### Online Marketplaces

**eBay** remains the largest marketplace for buying and selling Olde Frothingslosh collectibles. Current [eBay listings](https://www.ebay.com/b/Olde-Frothingslosh/3918/bn_7023249051) show a range of options, from vintage 1969 Miss Olde Frothingslosh cans starting around $7.99 to rarer specimens commanding higher prices. The competitive auction format can sometimes drive prices higher than expected for particularly sought-after cans.

**Etsy** has become another viable marketplace for brewing collectibles. The [Etsy Olde Frothingslosh marketplace](https://www.etsy.com/market/olde_frothingslosh) offers various cans, including vintage 1960s steel pull tab cans priced around $3.96 (on sale from original prices).

**Specialized Breweriana Websites** like [Bill's Beer Cans](https://www.billsbeercans.com/) offer curated selections of beer cans, including Olde Frothingslosh sets. Their Sir Reggie 4-color set (USBC #103-36/39) is listed at $3.00, providing a baseline for certain editions.

### Auctions and Collector Events

**Beer Can Specialty Auctions** such as those run by [Beer Cans Plus](https://auctions.beercansplus.com/_Three_Olde_Frothingslosh_Tab_Tops__Vol_II_103_18_-LOT11474.aspx) offer authenticated Olde Frothingslosh cans and occasionally complete sets. These specialized auctions often achieve higher prices than general marketplaces due to the concentrated audience of serious collectors.

**Breweriana Collector Shows** provide in-person opportunities to buy, sell, and trade with knowledgeable collectors. These events often feature appraisal services to help determine the value of your cans.

### Collector Forums and Communities

Online communities dedicated to breweriana collecting, such as the [Reddit breweriana subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/breweriana/), offer marketplace threads where collectors can connect directly. These communities also provide valuable information on pricing trends and can help identify unusual or rare can variations.

The [Brewery Collectibles Club of America (BCCA)](https://www.bcca.com/) is the primary organization for breweriana collectors and offers both online and in-person marketplaces for members, along with detailed valuation guides.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Identifying Authentic Olde Frothingslosh Cans" level="2" >}}
With the increasing value of vintage beer cans, being able to authenticate genuine Olde Frothingslosh cans is essential for collectors. Here's what to look for when evaluating potential additions to your collection.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Key Authentication Markers

**Production Codes**: Genuine Olde Frothingslosh cans typically have production codes stamped on the bottom or side of the can. These codes indicate the manufacturing date and facility.

**Material Weight and Quality**: According to dating information from [Breweriana.com](https://www.breweriana.com/beer-can-appraisal/how-to-date-cans.html), authentic vintage cans will have appropriate weight and material thickness for their era. Pre-1970s cans used heavier gauge metal than modern reproductions.

**Pittsburgh Brewing Company Markings**: Look for official Pittsburgh Brewing Company logos and text. The specific font styles and printing techniques evolved over decades but should match known examples from similar time periods.

**Internal Revenue Tax Statement**: Cans produced between June 1, 1935, and March 30, 1950, should have an "Internal Revenue Tax Paid" statement. This helps authenticate the earliest Olde Frothingslosh cans.

**Cataloged USBC Numbers**: The Beer Can Collectors of America (BCCA) catalog assigns United States Beer Can (USBC) numbers to authentic cans. For example, the Sir Reggie set has USBC #103-36/39 as noted on [Bill's Beer Cans](https://www.billsbeercans.com/).

### Common Reproduction Red Flags

**Inconsistent Aging**: Reproductions often show inconsistent aging patterns or artificially created "wear" that doesn't match natural oxidation and color fading patterns.

**Incorrect Opening Mechanisms**: The opening mechanism should match the can's purported era. For example, a supposed 1950s can with a pull tab would be immediately suspect, as pull tabs weren't introduced until the 1960s.

**Modern Printing Techniques**: Authentic vintage cans used different printing technologies than modern cans. Under magnification, the printing dots and color registration will differ between originals and reproductions.

**Weight Discrepancies**: Modern reproductions typically use lighter gauge metal than vintage originals. A can that feels too light for its supposed era is likely not authentic.

If you're uncertain about a can's authenticity, consulting with experienced collectors through organizations like the BCCA or getting an expert appraisal is recommended before making significant purchases.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Investment Potential of Olde Frothingslosh Cans" level="2" >}}
For those considering beer can collecting as an investment, Olde Frothingslosh presents some unique opportunities and considerations in today's market.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Market Trends and Growth Potential

The breweriana collecting market has seen steady growth in recent years, with rare and historical pieces appreciating most significantly. While not reaching the extreme prices of the most valuable beer cans in the world (like the [Perone Beer quart cone top can that sold for $62,830](https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2024/03/empty-beer-can-sells-for-record-breaking-us62k/)), Olde Frothingslosh cans have shown consistent appreciation due to their unique cultural significance and limited supply.

Key investment considerations include:

- **Rarity Factor**: The earliest Olde Frothingslosh cans (1955-1960s) have a naturally diminishing supply as cans deteriorate or become permanently held in established collections.

- **Cultural Significance**: The connection to Pittsburgh broadcasting history and the fictional-turned-real nature of the brand adds value beyond typical breweriana.

- **Condition Premium**: Mint or near-mint condition cans from the 1950s-1960s have shown the strongest price appreciation, sometimes doubling in value over 5-10 year periods.

- **Unopened Premium**: According to collector discussions on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/breweriana/comments/10nsiln/i_have_a_69_olde_frothingslosh_unopened_can_and/), unopened cans have become exceptionally rare and can command significant premiums.

### Collection Building Strategy

For investors looking to build a collection with appreciation potential:

1. **Focus on Condition**: Prioritize excellent to mint condition cans, especially for more common editions.

2. **Complete Sets**: Collections with complete series (like all Miss Olde Frothingslosh years or the full Sir Reggie color set) typically appreciate faster than individual cans.

3. **Rarity Focus**: The 1955 original and early editions from the 1960s have shown the strongest historical appreciation and will likely continue this trend.

4. **Storage Considerations**: Proper storage in climate-controlled environments, away from direct sunlight, will maintain condition and maximize long-term value.

5. **Authentication Documentation**: Maintain provenance documentation and authentication materials, which can significantly increase resale value to serious collectors.

While beer can collecting should primarily be pursued as a passion, Olde Frothingslosh cans represent a segment of the market with a documented track record of appreciation, particularly for the rarest examples in exceptional condition.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Olde Frothingslosh Beer Can Values" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the most valuable Olde Frothingslosh beer can?" >}}
    The original 1955 Olde Frothingslosh can is generally considered the most valuable to collectors, worth approximately $200-$300 in excellent condition. This was the first actual production can after the beer had existed only as a radio joke. The condition is critical to achieving top dollar, with mint examples commanding premium prices.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is Olde Frothingslosh still being made?" >}}
    Yes, Olde Frothingslosh has recently been revived. According to Pittsburgh Brewing Company's website, "Sir Reggie has made his return. Olde Frothingslosh officially returned in our gift shop and taproom for the 2024 holiday season." This revival creates new collecting opportunities, though these modern cans will likely take time to appreciate in value compared to vintage examples.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell how old my Olde Frothingslosh beer can is?" >}}
    You can determine the age of your Olde Frothingslosh can by examining several features:
    
    1. **Opening mechanism**: Flat-top cans (requiring a can opener) are from the 1950s-early 1960s, pull-tab cans are generally from the mid-1960s through 1970s, and stay-on tabs indicate 1980s or later.
    
    2. **Gauge/weight of metal**: Earlier cans used heavier gauge metal than modern versions.
    
    3. **Design elements**: Look for specific characters like Miss Olde Frothingslosh (Fatima Yechburgh), who first appeared in 1969, or Sir Reggie variations.
    
    4. **Tax statements**: Cans from before March 30, 1950, will have an "Internal Revenue Tax Paid" statement.
    
    5. **Production codes**: Bottom or side stamps often indicate production dates.
    
    For precise dating, consult resources like the Beer Can Collectors of America guides or specialized breweriana collectors.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are unopened Olde Frothingslosh beer cans worth more?" >}}
    Yes, unopened Olde Frothingslosh cans typically command a significant premium over empty ones. According to collector discussions on Reddit, unopened examples from the 1960s are exceptionally rare in today's market. An unopened 1969 Miss Olde Frothingslosh can could potentially sell for 2-5 times the value of an equivalent empty can, depending on condition and buyer interest.
    
    However, it's worth noting that very old unopened cans may have seepage or content degradation issues, which can affect their value. The condition of the exterior and the integrity of the seal are crucial factors.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where is the best place to sell Olde Frothingslosh beer cans?" >}}
    The best venues for selling Olde Frothingslosh cans depend on the rarity and value of your specific items:
    
    1. **eBay** is the largest marketplace with the widest audience, ideal for most cans.
    
    2. **Specialized Breweriana Auctions** like those at Beer Cans Plus may achieve higher prices for rare or valuable examples.
    
    3. **Collector Forums and Organizations** like the Brewery Collectibles Club of America connect you directly with serious collectors who may pay premium prices.
    
    4. **Etsy** has become a viable marketplace for moderately priced brewing collectibles.
    
    5. **In-person Breweriana Shows** allow for direct sales without platform fees and immediate payment.
    
    For the best results, research recent sales of similar cans before listing, provide detailed photos and condition descriptions, and consider having rare examples authenticated by experts.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What was special about Miss Olde Frothingslosh beer cans?" >}}
    The Miss Olde Frothingslosh beer cans, first introduced in 1969, featured Fatima Yechburgh, the fictional winner of a beauty pageant, portrayed by model Marsha Phillips. These cans are particularly collectible because:
    
    1. They represent a unique marketing approach featuring a 300-pound beauty queen, playfully subverting beauty standards of the era.
    
    2. Phillips was paid $800 for what was initially intended as a one-time promotion, but the cans became so popular they continued production.
    
    3. They have a compelling backstory detailed on beer history websites, adding cultural significance beyond typical beer memorabilia.
    
    4. The cans represent a significant evolution in the Olde Frothingslosh story, moving beyond the original Sir Reggie character.
    
    Their combination of humor, cultural significance, and limited production makes them particularly sought after by collectors focused on brewing history and advertising memorabilia.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Preservation Tips for Beer Can Collectors" level="2" >}}
Proper preservation techniques are essential for maintaining the value and condition of Olde Frothingslosh and other vintage beer cans in your collection.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Storage Environment

**Climate Control**: Store your collection in a space with stable temperature (60-70Â°F/15-21Â°C) and moderate humidity (40-50%). Avoid basements, attics, or garages with temperature fluctuations and humidity extremes.

**Light Protection**: UV light causes fading of colors and graphics. Keep cans away from direct sunlight and use UV-filtering display cases if exhibiting your collection.

**Dust Prevention**: Dust can be abrasive and damage graphics over time. Use enclosed display cases or cover stored cans with acid-free materials.

### Handling Best Practices

**Clean, Dry Hands**: Always handle cans with clean, dry hands or wear cotton gloves to prevent transferring oils and acids from your skin.

**Support Structure**: Hold cans by their base rather than pinching sides, which can cause dents or stress the seams.

**Avoid Cleaning**: For vintage cans, avoid cleaning or attempting to remove patina unless you have expertise in breweriana preservation. Improper cleaning can permanently damage collectible cans and reduce their value.

### Display Considerations

**Rotation**: If displaying cans, rotate them periodically to ensure even light exposure.

**Vertical Pressure**: When storing or displaying multiple cans, avoid stacking that puts vertical pressure on cans, which can cause collapse or seam damage.

**Documentation**: Keep an inventory with photographs documenting the condition of each can. This serves both for insurance purposes and to track any condition changes over time.

By following these preservation guidelines, you'll maximize both the longevity and value of your Olde Frothingslosh beer can collection, ensuring these pieces of brewing history remain in collectible condition for generations to come.

## Conclusion: The Enduring Appeal of Olde Frothingslosh Collectibles

Olde Frothingslosh beer cans represent more than just vintage brewerianaâ€”they embody a unique piece of American cultural history, blending radio humor, brewing tradition, and Pittsburgh heritage into highly collectible aluminum and steel artifacts. From the original 1955 cans worth hundreds of dollars to the more accessible 1970s editions, these distinctive collectibles continue to captivate beer can enthusiasts decades after their introduction.

For collectors, the combination of limited availability, cultural significance, and the whimsical "foam on the bottom" concept makes Olde Frothingslosh cans particularly appealing. Their value derives not just from age and condition but from the stories they tell about mid-century American humor and regional brewing traditions.

As Pittsburgh Brewing Company revives Olde Frothingslosh for new generations, the market for these collectibles will likely continue to evolve. Vintage examples, particularly those in excellent condition or unopened, will remain the most valuable, while new editions may eventually develop their own collector appeal.

Whether you're a serious breweriana investor or simply a nostalgic fan of Pittsburgh's brewing history, Olde Frothingslosh cans offer a tangible connection to a creative marketing concept that transformed from radio fiction to lasting collectible reality.
