{{< content-modules/section-header title="Understanding 1989 Quarter Value" level="2" >}}
For coin collectors and casual finders alike, knowing what makes a 1989 Washington quarter valuable can help you identify if you've discovered a common coin or something special worth preserving.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![1989 Washington Quarter showing obverse with George Washington profile](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1989-quarter-worth/how-much-is-a-1989-quarter-worth-image-1_j5ica7qig.png)

Most 1989 quarters you'll find in circulation are worth their face value of 25 cents, but certain factors can make them worth more to collectors. The 1989 quarter continues the long-running Washington quarter design that began in 1932, featuring George Washington's profile on the obverse (front) and an eagle on the reverse (back).

Let's look at what determines the value of your 1989 quarter:

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="1989 Quarter Key Facts" columns="3" / /  >}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Base Value by Mint Mark" level="2" >}}
The 1989 Washington quarter was minted at three different facilities, each identified by a mint mark (or lack thereof). These mint marks play a significant role in determining a coin's value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The mint mark can be found on the obverse (front) side of the quarter, just to the right of Washington's ponytail. Here's what each mint mark means and how it affects value:

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors That Affect 1989 Quarter Value" level="2" >}}
Beyond the mint mark, several other factors influence how much your 1989 quarter might be worth to collectors and numismatists.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![1989 quarter in uncirculated mint state condition](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1989-quarter-worth/how-much-is-a-1989-quarter-worth-image-3_G7fbXpT5O.png)

### Condition (Grade)

The condition of a coin has the most significant impact on its value. Numismatists use the Sheldon Scale to grade coins from 1 (Poor) to 70 (Perfect Uncirculated).

{{< interactive-modules/condition-checklist title="1989 Quarter Condition Assessment" description="Check applicable items to estimate your coin's grade" >}}
{{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="No visible wear (Mint State)" /  >}}
{{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Full mint luster present" /  >}}
{{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="No scratches or contact marks" /  >}}
{{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Sharp design details and lettering" /  >}}
{{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Clean fields (background areas)" /  >}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### Mint State Grading

For uncirculated 1989 quarters, the specific mint state grade makes a dramatic difference:

- **MS 60-63**: Common, worth $1-$3
- **MS 64-65**: More attractive, worth $5-$10
- **MS 66**: Getting scarce, worth $50-$175
- **MS 67**: Rare, worth $200-$500
- **MS 68+**: Extremely rare, potentially worth $1,000+

### Professional Certification

Quarters that have been professionally graded and certified by organizations like PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) or NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation) typically command higher prices than ungraded coins.

According to the [NGC Price Guide](https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/united-states/quarters/washington-quarters-1932-1998/15926/1989-p-25c-ms/), a professionally graded 1989 quarter in circulated condition is worth between $0.30 and $0.85.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Valuable 1989 Quarter Errors" level="2" >}}
Error coins are where the real value can be found in modern quarters. Manufacturing mistakes during the minting process created rare variants that collectors seek out.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![1989 quarter with doubling error highlighted](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1989-quarter-worth/how-much-is-a-1989-quarter-worth-image-4_ycmQkJgbp.png)

If you're lucky enough to find one of these error coins, they can be worth significantly more than regular 1989 quarters:

### Doubled Die Errors

These occur when the die used to strike the coin receives multiple impressions that are slightly offset:

- **1989 Doubled Die Obverse**: Shows doubling on Washington's features or inscriptions, can be worth $50-$100 depending on severity
- **1989 Doubled Die Reverse**: Shows doubling on the eagle or lettering, typically worth $25-$75

### Repunched Mint Marks

Sometimes the mint mark was stamped multiple times at slightly different positions:

- **1989-D Repunched Mint Mark**: According to coin forums and [video documentation](https://www.facebook.com/treasuretownyt/videos/1989-d-quarter-worth-money-how-much-is-it-worth-and-why/3721179068139207/), these can be worth $50 or more

### Off-Center Strikes

When a coin is not properly aligned during striking, the design appears off-center:

- **10-20% Off-Center**: Worth $20-$40
- **50% Off-Center (with date visible)**: Worth $100-$150

### Die Rotation Errors

When the reverse die is rotated from the standard 180-degree orientation:

- **90-Degree Rotation**: Worth $25-$50
- **180-Degree Rotation**: A [rare 1989 quarter with 180-degree rotated die error](https://www.ebay.com/b/Washington-Quarter-1989-US-Coin-Errors/524/bn_112544821) has been listed for as much as $800

### Other Errors

- **Wrong Planchet Errors**: If struck on a dime or nickel planchet, could be worth $200+
- **Multiple Strikes**: Worth $100+ depending on how dramatic the error is

### Best Places to Sell Valuable 1989 Quarters

1. **Online Marketplaces**:
   - eBay: The most popular platform for selling coins to collectors
   - Heritage Auctions: For very rare or valuable specimens

2. **Coin Dealers**:
   - Local coin shops
   - Coin shows and conventions
   - Professional numismatists

3. **Auction Houses**:

3. **Consider professional grading** for coins you believe are worth $50 or more
4. **Take clear, well-lit photographs** showing both sides of the coin
5. **Research recent sales** of similar coins to set a realistic price

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About 1989 Quarter Values" id="faq-section" >}}
{{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are 1989 quarters rare?" >}}
No, 1989 quarters are not considered rare coins. Over 1.4 billion were minted between the Philadelphia and Denver mints that year. However, high-grade uncirculated examples (MS-66 and above) and error varieties are scarce and can be valuable to collectors.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes a 1989 quarter valuable?" >}}
Several factors can make a 1989 quarter valuable:
- Exceptional condition (MS-66 or higher grade)
- Mint errors like doubled dies, off-center strikes, or wrong planchets
- Repunched mint marks (especially on 1989-D quarters)
- Professional certification by PCGS or NGC
- Complete absence of circulation wear
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I know if my 1989 quarter is worth more than face value?" >}}
Examine your 1989 quarter for these value-adding characteristics:
1. Check the mint mark (P, D, or S) to the right of Washington's ponytail
2. Look for errors like doubling, off-center strikes, or rotated dies
3. Assess the condition - no wear, scratches, or damage
4. Look for full luster and sharp details
5. Compare to high-resolution photos of valuable error coins online

If your coin is in uncirculated condition or shows signs of an error, it may be worth having it evaluated by a coin dealer or professional grading service.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the most valuable 1989 quarter error?" >}}
The most valuable 1989 quarter error is likely the 180-degree rotated die error, which has been listed for sale at $800 or more. Other valuable errors include significant off-center strikes (50% or more), wrong planchet errors, and dramatic doubled dies. The value depends on the rarity and visual impact of the specific error.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if I have a 1989-S proof quarter?" >}}
A 1989-S proof quarter has these distinguishing characteristics:
- A clear "S" mint mark to the right of Washington's ponytail
- Mirrorlike, reflective fields (background areas)
- Frosted, detailed design elements
- Sharp, well-defined edges
- Originally sold only in proof sets, not released for circulation
- Typically more pristine than regular strike coins

Proof quarters were specially made for collectors and have a distinctive appearance that sets them apart from regular circulation strikes.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is a 1989 quarter with no mint mark valuable?" >}}
A 1989 quarter with no visible mint mark is most likely a Philadelphia (P) issue, as the Philadelphia mint did add the "P" mint mark to quarters starting in 1980. Check carefully, as the mint mark can sometimes be weak or filled in.

If you truly have a 1989 quarter with no mint mark when it should have one, it could be a mint error called a "missing mint mark," which would make it more valuable to collectors. However, this would be quite rare, and you should have it authenticated by a professional.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="What state quarter was released in 1999 that could be worth $10,000?" >}}
While not directly related to 1989 quarters, collectors often ask about valuable state quarters. The 1999 Georgia state quarter could potentially be worth up to $10,000 if it has specific manufacturing errors. These include major off-center strikes, double strikes, or being struck on the wrong planchet. This is mentioned in connection with a [MassLive article](https://www.masslive.com/entertainment/2025/01/state-quarter-from-1999-could-be-worth-10k-how-to-check-if-you-have-one.html) that discusses the high value of error state quarters.

While most 1989 quarters will only be worth their face value of 25 cents, understanding what makes certain specimens valuable can help you identify potential treasures in your pocket change or collection.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The most valuable 1989 quarters are those with significant errors or in pristine uncirculated condition. With over 1.4 billion quarters minted that year, finding a truly valuable example requires patience and a keen eye for detail.

If you think you've found a valuable 1989 quarter with an error or in high grade, consider having it authenticated by a reputable coin dealer or professional grading service. The investment in professional grading can be worthwhile for coins that potentially have significant numismatic value.

Remember that coin values fluctuate based on collector demand, discovery of new varieties, and overall market conditions. Stay informed by referencing current price guides and auction results to get the most accurate valuation of your 1989 quarters.

Whether you're a dedicated numismatist or simply curious about the change in your pocket, the hunt for valuable coins adds an element of treasure hunting to everyday life—you never know when you might discover something special.
