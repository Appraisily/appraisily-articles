### Common Antique Glass Colors and Their Significance

**Cobalt Blue:** This deep, intense blue has been produced since ancient times. In 19th-century America, cobalt blue glass was popular for medicine bottles and decorative items. Pieces from manufacturers like Fenton and Bristol remain highly collectible.

**Ruby Red/Cranberry:** One of the most expensive colors to produce, ruby glass contains gold chloride, making genuine antique pieces particularly valuable. Hold suspect pieces up to light—authentic ruby glass will have a distinctive glow.

**Vaseline/Uranium Glass:** Easily identifiable by its yellow-green appearance that glows bright green under UV light due to uranium oxide content. Production largely ended in the mid-20th century, making authentic pieces increasingly valuable.

**Carnival Glass:** Featuring an iridescent surface created by applying metallic salts before the final firing. Originally produced as an inexpensive alternative to costly Tiffany glass, it's now highly collectible.

**Depression Glass:** Mass-produced during the 1920s-1940s in colors like pink, green, amber, and blue. Often distributed as promotional items or premiums during the Great Depression.

**Amethyst/Purple Glass:** Natural exposure to manganese in early glass can result in purple hues through long-term sun exposure. Artificially "purpled" glass exists, so careful authentication is essential.

**Milk Glass:** Opaque white glass that's been produced since the 16th century. American milk glass from companies like Westmoreland and Fenton saw peak popularity in the late 19th to mid-20th centuries.

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Colored Glass Value Indicators" columns="3" / /  >}}

**Age Impact:** Glassware over 100 years old can command 200-400% higher prices than similar mid-century pieces.

**Color Rarity:** Unusual colors like red, deep purple, and certain blue shades typically value 50-300% higher than common colors.

**Condition Importance:** Mint condition pieces often sell for 70-80% more than those with chips or cracks.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Makers' Marks and Signatures" level="2" >}}
Identifying makers' marks is crucial for authenticating colored antique glassware. While not all vintage glass carries marks, many manufacturers used distinctive signatures, etched marks, or paper labels to identify their products.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Close-up image of makers' marks on the bottom of colored antique glassware pieces](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/colored-antique-glassware-identification/colored-antique-glassware-identification-image-3_LNEzBtpyA.png)

### How to Locate Glass Marks

1. **Check the base:** Most manufacturers placed their marks on the bottom of the piece.
2. **Look for raised or impressed marks:** Many pressed glass pieces have mold marks or logos impressed into the glass.
3. **Examine for acid-etched signatures:** Higher-end art glass often featured etched signatures.
4. **Search for paper labels:** Though often missing on antique pieces, some may retain their original paper labels.

### Notable Glass Manufacturers and Their Marks

**Fenton:** Founded in 1905, Fenton is known for carnival glass, milk glass, and colored art glass. Early pieces were unmarked, but after 1970, most pieces carry the oval "Fenton" logo. Some hand-painted pieces have artists' signatures.

**Imperial Glass:** Founded in 1901, known for carnival glass, especially in purple/amethyst. Early pieces often unmarked, but after 1950, look for the "IG" logo with a crown.

**Cambridge Glass:** Operating from 1901 to 1958, they produced distinctive colors including Carmen (ruby red) and Heatherbloom (lavender). Look for the "C" in a triangle or "Cambridge" stamps.

**Northwood:** Famous for carnival glass from 1908-1925. Their most valuable pieces feature an underlined "N" in a circle.

**Blenko:** Known for vibrant colored art glass since 1893. Early pieces were rarely marked, but later items may have paper labels or acid-etched marks.

**Steuben:** Produced fine colored art glass from 1903-1932, then focused on clear crystal. Look for acid-etched "Steuben" signatures on the base.

**Tiffin/US Glass:** Made high-quality colored glassware from 1888-1980. Marks include "Tiffin" in script or "US Glass" with a number.

Beyond color and makers' marks, several physical characteristics can help authenticate and date colored antique glassware. These manufacturing telltales often provide definitive evidence of age and authenticity.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Pontil Marks

A pontil mark is a rough area on the base of hand-blown glass where the pontil rod was attached during manufacturing. These marks are strong indicators of handcrafted, older glass:

- **Open Pontil (pre-1860):** A rough, often sharp circular scar
- **Smooth Base Pontil (1860-1880):** A more polished circular mark
- **No Pontil (post-1880):** Machine-made glass typically lacks pontil marks

### Mold Seams and Lines

Examine the glass for mold seams, which can indicate how and when it was produced:

- **Hand-blown glass (pre-1880s):** No mold seams
- **Blown-in-mold (1880s-1920s):** Seams that typically stop at the neck
- **Machine-made (post-1920s):** Seams that run completely through the finish

### Bubbles and Imperfections

Early glassmaking techniques couldn't eliminate air bubbles, making their presence an indicator of age:

- **Numerous or large bubbles:** Typically indicates pre-1920s manufacture
- **Uneven thickness or asymmetry:** Suggests handcrafted production
- **Striations in the glass:** Often seen in older, hand-mixed batches of glass

### Weight and Feel

The physical heft and texture of glass can provide authentication clues:
