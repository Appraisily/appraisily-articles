{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Hand-Operated Implements

Hand tools represent the earliest and most diverse category of antique farm implements. These were entirely powered by manual labor and include:

1. **Scythes and Sickles** - Used for harvesting crops, these cutting tools feature curved blades and wooden handles. Scythes typically have longer handles and were used while standing, while sickles have shorter handles for cutting with one hand.

2. **Hoes and Cultivators** - Essential for soil preparation and weed control, antique hoes came in various shapes for different purposes, including grubbing hoes, draw hoes, and push hoes.

3. **Pitchforks and Hayforks** - Used for moving hay and other materials, antique pitchforks typically featured wooden handles with forged metal tines. The number and arrangement of tines can help identify specific types and uses.

4. **Dibbers and Planters** - Specialized tools used for creating holes for seeds or seedlings. Antique dibbers were often handcrafted from wood with metal tips.

5. **Corn Huskers and Shuckers** - Devices featuring a peg or hook attached to the hand with a leather strap, used to remove husks from corn before mechanized harvesting.

### Animal-Powered Equipment

As farming evolved, implements powered by livestock became common:

1. **Yokes and Harnesses** - Wooden yokes for oxen or leather harnesses for horses allowed animals to pull plows and other equipment.

2. **Horse-Drawn Plows** - Including walking plows, riding plows, and specialties like moldboard plows, these implements revolutionized field preparation.

3. **Seed Drills and Planters** - Horse-drawn mechanical seeders allowed for more uniform planting and increased efficiency.

4. **Hay Rakes and Tedders** - Used for gathering cut hay into windrows for drying and collection.

### Processing Tools

These tools were used to process harvested crops:

1. **Grain Flails and Threshers** - Used to separate grain from stalks before mechanical threshers became available.

2. **Corn Shellers** - Hand-cranked devices that removed kernels from corn cobs.

3. **Chaff Cutters** - Tools used to cut straw or hay into small pieces for animal feed.

4. **Grain Cradles** - Frame attachments for scythes that allowed grain to be collected as it was cut.
