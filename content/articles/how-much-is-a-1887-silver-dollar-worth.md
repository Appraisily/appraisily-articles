{{< content-modules/section-header title="History of the 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar" level="2" >}}
The Morgan Silver Dollar, designed by George T. Morgan, was produced from 1878 to 1904, and again in 1921. The 1887 issue came during a period of high production, with coins minted at three different facilities.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The Morgan dollar series came about as a result of the Bland-Allison Act of 1878, which required the U.S. Treasury to purchase large amounts of silver and convert it into silver dollars. This legislation was largely a response to lobbying from mining interests in the western United States after silver discoveries in Nevada and other states.

The 1887 issue saw substantial mintage numbers across three facilities:

{{< visual-modules/timeline title="1887 Morgan Dollar Production Timeline" >}}
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1887" title="Philadelphia Mint (No Mint Mark)" >}}
    Produced 20,290,000 Morgan dollars - the highest production of any mint for this year.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1887" title="New Orleans Mint (O Mint Mark)" >}}
    Produced 11,550,000 Morgan dollars, making it the second highest in production volume.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1887" title="San Francisco Mint (S Mint Mark)" >}}
    Produced 1,771,000 Morgan dollars - significantly fewer than the other two mints.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
{{< /visual-modules/timeline >}}

According to research from PCGS, the amount of silver used in the 1887 coinage was 28,588,682.89 standard ounces, at a cost of $25,343,272.39, representing a significant government investment in silver currency at the time.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1887 Morgan Dollar Value Chart" level="2" >}}
The value of an 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar varies significantly based on its mint mark and condition. Below are current market values for different mint marks and grades.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1887 Morgan Dollar Value by Mint Mark and Grade" description="Market values as of April 2025" >}}

    <td>Uncirculated (MS60-MS66)</td>
  </tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

As evident from the value chart, the 1887-S Morgan dollars typically command higher prices in better conditions due to their lower mintage numbers. The Philadelphia (no mint mark) coins, having been produced in the highest numbers, are generally the most affordable in circulated conditions.

According to USA Coin Book, an 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar (Philadelphia mint) is worth approximately $56 in average condition, while the NGC Price Guide indicates values between $42 and $63 for circulated specimens.

Several key factors determine how much your 1887 Morgan Silver Dollar is worth. Understanding these can help you better assess your coin's value.

- **New Orleans (O)**: Moderate value, especially in higher grades
- **San Francisco (S)**: Most valuable due to lower mintage

### Condition (Grade)

The condition or grade of your coin is perhaps the most critical factor affecting its value. Morgan dollars are graded on the Sheldon scale from 1 to 70:

### Special Characteristics

Certain characteristics can significantly increase an 1887 Morgan dollar's value:

- **Deep Mirror Prooflike (DMPL)**: Coins with mirror-like surfaces can be worth significantly more
- **VAM Varieties**: Specific die variations cataloged by Van Allen-Mallis can command premiums
- **Toning**: Attractive natural toning can increase value to collectors
- **Error Coins**: Doubling, die cracks, or other errors can make a coin more valuable

  </tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

### Prooflike and Deep Mirror Prooflike Specimens

Prooflike (PL) and Deep Mirror Prooflike (DMPL) Morgan dollars exhibit mirror-like surfaces that resemble proof coins. These characteristics can significantly increase value:

- **Prooflike (PL)**: 50-100% premium over standard Mint State coins
- **Deep Mirror Prooflike (DMPL)**: 100-400+% premium over standard Mint State coins

According to PCGS, an 1887 Morgan dollar in MS65 condition might be worth around $175, while the same coin with DMPL characteristics could fetch $700 or more.

2. **Auction Houses**
   - Advantages: Potential for highest prices, especially for rare varieties
   - Considerations: Commissions typically 10-20%, waiting period for payment
