  Understanding the artist's background and career can help collectors appreciate the value behind these coveted figurines.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Giuseppe Armani (1935-2006) was an Italian sculptor and artist renowned for his figurines crafted in the Capodimonte tradition. Born in Calci, Italy, Armani developed his artistic talents early in life and eventually joined the Florence Sculpture Academy. In 1975, he began his collaboration with the Florence Line company (later known as "Florence by Giuseppe Armani"), where he created his most celebrated works.

Armani's distinctive style combined classical aesthetics with contemporary sensibilities, resulting in figurines that captured the grace and beauty of the human form with remarkable detail and emotional expression. His works range from elegant ladies and dancers to children, clowns, and eventually, his famous Disney character interpretations.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors Affecting Armani Figurine Values" level="2" >}}
  Several key elements determine how much an Armani figurine is worth in today's collector's market.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The value of Giuseppe Armani figurines can vary significantly based on numerous factors. Understanding these elements will help you better assess the potential worth of your collection:

### Rarity and Limited Editions

Limited production runs typically command higher prices in the collectibles market. Armani figurines that were produced in strictly limited quantities—often numbered and accompanied by certificates of authenticity—can be worth substantially more than regular production pieces.

### Condition

The condition of a figurine is perhaps the most critical factor affecting its value. Mint condition pieces (those with no chips, cracks, or repairs) can fetch prices several times higher than damaged examples of the same figurine.

  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Certificate of authenticity present" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Base is undamaged with clear markings" / / />}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### Design and Subject Matter

Certain types of Armani figurines consistently command higher prices. Elegant lady figurines, particularly those in elaborate dresses or dynamic poses, tend to be more valuable. The Disney collection pieces are also among the most sought-after, especially rare or early editions.

### Signature and Markings

Authentic Giuseppe Armani figurines bear specific markings that confirm their authenticity. These typically include:

- The "Giuseppe Armani" signature
- A unique identification number
- "Florence" or "Made in Italy" markings
- The copyright symbol and year

### Original Packaging and Documentation

Complete sets with original boxes, certificates of authenticity, and related documentation can significantly increase value. Some collectors are willing to pay a premium for figurines that come with their complete original presentation materials.

  Learn which Giuseppe Armani figurines command premium prices in today's collector's market.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

While many Armani figurines hold value, certain pieces are particularly sought after by collectors and can command premium prices:

### Limited Edition Disney Collection

Armani's interpretations of Disney characters, especially those produced in limited numbers, are among his most valuable works. Early releases and characters from classic Disney films tend to be the most desirable.

### "C" Finish Figurines

Armani created figurines with different finishes, with the "C" finish (capodimonte-style) being particularly sought after. These pieces feature a warmer, more traditional look compared to the cooler, more contemporary appearance of other finishes.

![Giuseppe Armani Disney collection figurine showing the detailed craftsmanship](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-are-giuseppe-armani-figurines-worth/how-much-are-giuseppe-armani-figurines-worth-image-4_x_lxDeasH.png)

### Early Works (Pre-1990)

Figurines created in the earlier years of Armani's career with Florence Line (before 1990) are increasingly difficult to find in good condition, making them more valuable to collectors.

### Retired Pieces

When a design is retired or discontinued, its value often increases as the supply becomes permanently limited. The Giuseppe Armani Database (giuseppearmani.org) maintains records of retired pieces that can help collectors identify potentially valuable items.

### Large and Complex Sculptures

Larger figurines (over 12 inches tall) featuring complex designs, multiple figures, or elaborate bases typically command higher prices due to their impressive presence and the greater skill required to create them.

{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Maintaining your Giuseppe Armani figurines in excellent condition is essential for preserving their value. Here are some expert recommendations for proper care:

### Cleaning Techniques

The most effective way to clean Armani figurines is with extreme gentleness:

1. Fill a bowl with warm (not hot) water and add a small amount of mild dishwashing liquid
2. Dip a very soft, lint-free cloth into the solution and gently wipe the figurine
3. Avoid submerging the piece in water
4. Use a dry, soft cloth to carefully pat the figurine dry

### Handling Precautions

When handling Armani figurines:
