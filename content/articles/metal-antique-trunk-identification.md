    To distinguish between genuine antiques and reproductions:
    
    1. Examine the hardware for machine-made uniformity (suggests reproduction)
    2. Look for modern fasteners like Phillips head screws
    3. Check for artificially aged finishes versus authentic patina
    4. Assess the weight (reproductions often use lighter materials)
    5. Evaluate the wear patterns (authentic trunks show logical wear at contact points)
    6. Examine interior construction for modern materials
    
    Reproductions became popular in the 1970s-1980s and continue today, often with artificially "distressed" finishes to mimic age.
