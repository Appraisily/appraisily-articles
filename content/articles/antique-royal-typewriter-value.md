{{< content-modules/section-header title="The Royal Typewriter Company: A Brief History" level="2" >}}
Understanding the historical context of Royal typewriters provides valuable insight into their collectibility and value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The Royal Typewriter Company was founded in 1904 by Edward B. Hess and Lewis C. Myers in Brooklyn, New York. Their first model, the Royal Standard, was introduced to the market in March 1906. What set Royal apart from competitors was its innovative "flatbed" design, which quickly gained popularity for its durability and reliability.

Royal was known for its innovations throughout the 20th century, including the "Touch Control" feature in the 1930s and the "Magic Margin" feature introduced in 1939. The company was eventually acquired by Litton Industries in 1954 and continued producing typewriters until the rise of personal computers significantly reduced demand for typewriters in the 1980s.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Key Factors That Determine Royal Typewriter Value" level="2" >}}
Several important elements contribute to the market value of vintage Royal typewriters. Understanding these factors will help you properly assess your machine's worth.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

When determining the value of an antique Royal typewriter, collectors and appraisers consider the following key factors:

### 1. Age and Model

Older Royal models, particularly those from the early 1900s through the 1940s, typically command higher prices. Pre-1930s models with glass keys are especially valuable.

### 2. Condition

The functional and aesthetic condition dramatically impacts value. Working mechanisms, original paint, and minimal rust or damage are crucial for maximum value.

{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### 3. Rarity and Special Features

Limited production models, unusual colors, or typewriters with special features like rare keyboard layouts can be worth significantly more than standard models.

### 4. Provenance

A typewriter with documented history—particularly one owned by a famous author or historical figure—can command a premium price well above standard valuations.

### 5. Restoration Status

Professional restoration can enhance value for rare models, though collectors often prefer original unrestored machines with natural patina for common models.

It's important to note that particularly rare models, those in exceptional condition, or machines with documented provenance can sell for significantly more than these ranges. For example, a Royal typewriter owned by a famous author could fetch thousands of dollars at auction.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How to Identify Your Royal Typewriter Model and Year" level="2" >}}
Accurate identification is crucial for determining the true value of your Royal typewriter. Here's how to identify your specific model and production year.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

To properly identify your Royal typewriter, follow these steps:

### 1. Locate the Serial Number

The serial number is typically found on the top of the frame under the right end of the carriage. On some models, you may need to move the carriage all the way to the left to reveal the number.

### 2. Check the Model Name

Look for the model name on the front of the typewriter or on the paper table behind the carriage. Common names include "Royal Standard," "Royal Portable," "Royal Quiet De Luxe," etc.

### 3. Use the Typewriter Database

The Typewriter Database (typewriterdatabase.com) maintains comprehensive serial number records for Royal typewriters. Enter your serial number to find your typewriter's approximate production year.

![Close-up of Royal typewriter serial number location](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/antique-royal-typewriter-value/antique-royal-typewriter-value-image-5_gEgwA5tRE.png)

### 4. Identify Key Features

Certain features can help date your typewriter:
- Glass keys (typical of pre-1940s models)
- Touch Control feature (introduced in the 1930s)
- Magic Margin feature (introduced in 1939)
- Color (two-tone models were popular in certain eras)
- Keyboard layout (QWERTY vs. specialized layouts)

### 5. Consult Typewriter Collectors' Resources

For unusual or rare models, specialized collector forums and reference books can provide valuable identification assistance.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Antique Royal Typewriter Values" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell how old my Royal Typewriter is?" >}}
    To determine the age of your Royal typewriter, locate the serial number (typically found on the top of the frame under the right end of the carriage) and consult the Typewriter Database (typewriterdatabase.com). Enter your serial number to find your typewriter's approximate production year. Physical characteristics like glass keys (pre-1940s), the Touch Control feature (1930s), or the Magic Margin feature (introduced in 1939) can also help narrow down the manufacturing period.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is my 1950s Royal typewriter worth?" >}}
    A Royal typewriter from the 1950s typically values between $50-$400, depending on the specific model, condition, and color. The Royal Quiet De Luxe from this period generally sells for $200-$400 in excellent working condition, while standard office models might fetch $100-$200. Rare colors like turquoise, red, or pink can command premium prices. A typewriter that's been professionally reconditioned can add approximately $75-$100 to the base value.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are antique typewriters worth anything?" >}}
    Yes, antique typewriters can be quite valuable, with some rare models selling for hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Royal typewriters from the 1920s-1940s with glass keys typically sell for $500-$800 in good condition. Early Royal Standard models (1906-1930s) can fetch $300-$800. Factors that increase value include rare models, unusual colors, excellent condition, complete original accessories, and documented provenance. However, common models from the 1970s may only be worth $50-$100 unless in pristine condition.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How old does a typewriter have to be to be considered antique?" >}}
    By strict definition in the United States, an item must be at least 100 years old to be considered a true antique. This means Royal typewriters made before 1923 would qualify as genuine antiques. Typewriters made between the 1920s and 1970s are more accurately described as "vintage" rather than antique. However, in collector circles, the terms are often used more loosely, with machines from the pre-WWII era (pre-1945) commonly referred to as antique typewriters regardless of their exact age.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What year did Royal Typewriter come out?" >}}
    The Royal Typewriter Company was founded in 1904 by Edward B. Hess and Lewis C. Myers in Brooklyn, New York. The first Royal typewriter model, the Royal Standard, was introduced to the market in March 1906. This model featured the innovative "flatbed" design that would set Royal apart from its competitors. The company later expanded its lineup with the introduction of the Royal Portable in 1926, which became one of their most successful product lines.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I clean my antique Royal typewriter?" >}}
    To clean an antique Royal typewriter safely:
    
    1. Start with compressed air or a soft brush to remove dust and debris
    2. Use specialized typewriter cleaning supplies rather than household cleaners
    3. Clean the type bars and typeslugs with denatured alcohol on cotton swabs
    4. Gently clean the platen (rubber roller) with a slightly damp cloth
    5. Polish metal parts with appropriate metal cleaners, avoiding painted surfaces
    6. Apply a small amount of gun oil or specialized typewriter oil to moving parts if needed
    
    For valuable machines, consider consulting a professional typewriter technician for cleaning and maintenance.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where can I sell my vintage Royal typewriter?" >}}

    3. Local antique shops or consignment stores
    4. Specialty typewriter shops that buy used machines
    5. Auction houses (for rare or valuable models)

  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes some Royal typewriters more valuable than others?" >}}

## Conclusion: The Enduring Appeal of Royal Typewriters

Antique Royal typewriters continue to captivate collectors with their mechanical precision, historical significance, and aesthetic appeal. Whether you're assessing a family heirloom or building a typewriter collection, understanding the factors that influence Royal typewriter values will help you make informed decisions.

The most valuable Royal typewriters remain those from the pre-1940s era, particularly portable models with glass keys in excellent working condition. However, mid-century models continue to gain appreciation among decorators and typewriter enthusiasts seeking usable vintage machines.

As with any collectible, condition remains paramount, with working machines commanding significant premiums over non-functional examples. Original accessories, cases, and documentation further enhance value, as does any documented connection to notable users or historical events.

Whether your Royal typewriter is worth $100 or $1,000, these magnificent machines represent an important chapter in the history of communication technology—a tangible connection to an era when the written word was produced through an intricate dance of mechanical components, all working in perfect harmony.
