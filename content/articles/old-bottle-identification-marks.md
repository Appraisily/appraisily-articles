Antique and vintage bottles can reveal fascinating stories about our past, from medicine and household products to spirits and beverages. One of the most reliable ways to determine a bottle's age, origin, and potential value is by deciphering the identification marks left by manufacturers. These distinctive symbols, embossings, and base stamps serve as a historical fingerprint that can help collectors and enthusiasts date and authenticate their finds.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Collection of antique bottles showing various embossed designs and manufacturer marks](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-bottle-identification-marks/old-bottle-identification-marks-image-1_KpuJN8-ku.png)

Whether you've discovered an old bottle while metal detecting, inherited family heirlooms, or are building a dedicated collection, understanding how to read these marks is essential for proper identification. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the various types of bottle identification marks, what they mean, and how they can help you determine a bottle's approximate age, manufacturer, and potential value.

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Key Facts About Antique Bottle Marks" columns="3" / /  >}}
- **1860s-1920s**: Peak period for embossed bottle production
- **25,000+**: Approximate number of different glass manufacturers marks documented
- **400%**: Potential increase in value for bottles with rare or historical maker's marks

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Types of Bottle Identification Marks" level="2" >}}
Old bottles feature several distinct types of identification marks that provide different pieces of information about their origin and age. Learning to recognize these various marking styles is the first step in bottle identification.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Pontil Marks

Among the oldest and most distinctive bottle identification features are pontil marks. These circular scars on the base of a bottle indicate it was made using a blowpipe and pontil rod during handblown production, typically predating the 1860s. According to the [Society for Historical Archaeology](https://sha.org/bottle/), these marks are key diagnostic characteristics of mid-19th century and earlier bottles.

Pontil marks appear in several varieties:
- **Open Pontil**: A rough, circular scar with sharp edges
- **Sand Pontil**: A grainy, sandpaper-like texture within the circular area
- **Iron Pontil**: A reddish-brown or graphite-colored deposit within the scar, sometimes called a "improved pontil"
- **Glass-tipped Pontil**: A smooth, glass-covered circular mark

The presence of any pontil mark generally indicates a bottle made before 1865, with some regional variations, making these bottles particularly valuable to collectors.

### Embossed Markings

![Close-up of embossed lettering on the side of an antique bottle](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-bottle-identification-marks/old-bottle-identification-marks-image-2_iqYpQKMUU.png)

Embossed markings—raised letters, numbers, or designs molded directly into the glass—are common on bottles manufactured from the 1870s through the early 1900s. According to the [glass bottle marks database](https://glassbottlemarks.com/), these embossings may appear on the bottle's:

- **Base**: Often containing maker's marks or bottle codes
- **Sides**: Frequently displaying product names, company information, or city of origin
- **Shoulder**: Sometimes showing product volume or manufacturer details
- **Neck**: Occasionally including dating codes or product information

Embossed statements like "Federal law forbids sale or reuse of this bottle" indicate the bottle was produced during Prohibition or shortly after (1933-1964), while "NOT TO BE REFILLED" emerged in the post-1960s era.

### Maker's Marks

Manufacturer's marks are among the most useful identification tools for bottle collectors. These symbols, initials, or logos typically appear on the bottle's base and identify which glass company produced the container. The [SHA Bottle website](https://sha.org/bottle/makersmarks.htm) provides an extensive database of these marks.

Common maker's marks include:
- "I" inside a diamond (Illinois Glass Company, 1916-1929)
- "O-I" inside a diamond (Owens-Illinois, 1929-1954)
- "B" inside a circle (Brockway Glass Company, 1925-1983)
- "F" inside a hexagon (Foster-Forbes Glass Company, 1942-1995)

Identifying the maker's mark can significantly narrow down a bottle's age and origin, especially when used in conjunction with other identification features.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Dating Bottles by Manufacturing Characteristics" level="2" >}}
Beyond specific marks, the physical characteristics of a bottle provide valuable clues about its age. The production methods used throughout different eras left distinctive traits that help establish manufacturing dates.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Historic bottle showing visible mold seams and base marks used for dating](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-bottle-identification-marks/old-bottle-identification-marks-image-3_HCSpvDnQE.png)

### Mold Seams

Mold seams are the vertical lines that run up the sides of a bottle where sections of the mold met during production. Their height and appearance changed over time with advances in bottle-making technology:

- **Pre-1860**: Faint or no visible seams (free-blown bottles)
- **1860s-1880s**: Seams extending up to the bottle shoulder, then disappearing 
- **1880s-1910s**: Seams extending to the neck, but not all the way to the lip
- **Post-1910**: Seams running completely from base to top of the lip (machine-made bottles)

According to [bottle dating resources](https://sha.org/bottle/dating.htm), the presence and height of these mold seams is one of the most reliable dating tools available to collectors.

### Base Marks and Codes

The base of a bottle often contains a wealth of information:

- **Numbers**: May indicate mold numbers, plant codes, or date codes
- **Symbols**: Can represent the glass maker or specific manufacturing techniques
- **Letters**: Often abbreviations for the manufacturing company
- **Dot patterns**: In more modern bottles, these can indicate precise manufacturing dates

For bottles produced after 1930, many manufacturers began using more standardized date coding systems. For example, Owens-Illinois used a two-digit year code to the right of their logo from the 1930s through the 1950s.

{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

### Lip and Finish Types

The "finish" refers to the top portion of the bottle including the lip. Different finish styles were prevalent during specific eras:

- **Applied Lip/Finish**: Hand-tooled separately from the bottle body (pre-1910) 
- **Tooled Finish**: Applied glass that was then reshaped with tools (1870s-1910s)
- **Machine-Made Finish**: Uniform, seamless appearance with mold seams extending through the finish (post-1910)

According to [Antique Trader](https://www.antiquetrader.com/collectibles/bottle-trademark-identification), the finish style can be one of the most reliable indicators of a bottle's approximate age.

{{< visual-modules/timeline title="Evolution of Bottle Manufacturing Techniques" >}}

![Various bottle bases showing manufacturer marks and date codes](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-bottle-identification-marks/old-bottle-identification-marks-image-4_NKO7XZksr.png)

### Common Numeric Codes

According to [Glass Bottle Marks](https://glassbottlemarks.com/numbers-on-bottoms-of-glass-bottles/), numbers on bottle bases typically represent:

1. **Mold Numbers**: Single digits or small numbers that identify specific molds used in production
2. **Plant Codes**: Numbers indicating which factory produced the bottle
3. **Date Codes**: Often appearing as one or two digits representing the year of manufacture
4. **Liquor Bottle Codes**: Special numeric systems used for distillery products

For bottles made after 1930, date codes became more standardized. For instance, Owens-Illinois bottles from 1940 would typically show "40" or "4." positioned near the maker's mark.

### Letters and Symbols

Letters on bottle bases may represent:
- Manufacturer initials or abbreviations
- City or plant location codes
- Mold engraver's marks
- Product batch identifiers

Some common symbols include:
- Diamonds, circles, and squares surrounding letters or numbers (manufacturer logos)
- Dots or periods flanking numbers (often date indicators)
- Geometric patterns unique to specific glass companies

The comprehensive [glass manufacturers' marks database](https://glassbottlemarks.com/bottlemarks/) catalogs hundreds of these symbols to aid in identification.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Identifying Bottles by Style and Design" level="2" >}}
Beyond physical marks and manufacturing characteristics, the overall style, design, and color of a bottle can provide important clues about its age, purpose, and origin.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Bottle Shapes and Forms

Different bottle shapes were developed for specific contents:

- **Flask shapes**: Often contained spirits, with distinctive flattened designs
- **Cylinder bottles**: Common for sodas and mineral waters
- **Square/rectangular**: Frequently used for medicines, bitters, and some foods
- **Figural bottles**: Novelty shapes (animals, people, buildings) generally indicating specialty products

The [Society for Historical Archaeology's bottle typing guide](https://sha.org/bottle/typing.htm) provides detailed information on how to identify bottle types by their shape and form.

### Glass Colors and Production Methods

The color of glass can help narrow down a bottle's age:

- **Aqua/light blue-green**: Natural glass color when no additives used (common pre-1920)
- **Deep blues and greens**: Popular for poisons, sodas, and mineral waters (1880s-1920s)
- **Amber/brown**: Common for beers and medicines (became standardized after 1910)
- **Purple/amethyst**: Contains manganese which turns purple with sun exposure (1880s-1920)
- **Black glass**: Actually very dark olive or amber, common in early bottles (pre-1870s)
- **Milk glass**: Opaque white, popular for cosmetics and ointments (1890s-1950s)

![Collection of antique bottles in various colors showing how glass color aids in identification](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-bottle-identification-marks/old-bottle-identification-marks-image-5_OxYlMUGt_.png)

According to [TrueLegacyHomes](https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/age-glass-bottles/), certain colors were produced only during specific time periods, making color one of the helpful indicators of a bottle's approximate age.

  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do you date a bottle?" >}}
    Dating bottles involves analyzing multiple physical characteristics:

    1. **Manufacturing technique**: 
       - Pontil marks (pre-1860s)
       - Applied lips (pre-1910)
       - Machine-made seams running through the finish (post-1910)
    
    2. **Maker's marks**: 
       - Research manufacturer logos to establish production dates
       - Date codes near maker's marks (common post-1930)
    
    3. **Glass characteristics**:
       - Manganese-purpled glass (1880s-1920)
       - Automatic machine stippling on bases (post-1940)
       - Suction scars on bases (1905-1950s)
    
    4. **Product-specific dating clues**:
       - "Federal law forbids..." (1933-1964)
       - Graduated metric measurements (generally post-1970s in US)
       - ZIP codes in addresses (post-1963)
       
    Most bottle manufacturers molded year codes into bases in a 2-digit format, often found in the lower right portion when looking at the bottom. Dating is most accurate when multiple characteristics are considered together rather than relying on a single feature.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What do the numbers on the bottom of glass bottles mean?" >}}
    Numbers on bottle bases typically indicate:

    1. **Date codes**: One or two digits representing the year of manufacture (ex: "8" could mean 1938 or 1948, depending on other characteristics)
    
    2. **Mold numbers**: Identify specific molds used in production, helping manufacturers track quality issues
    
    3. **Plant codes**: Numbers indicating which factory produced the bottle (especially in companies with multiple facilities)
    
    4. **Liquid capacity**: Sometimes indicates bottle volume (particularly on liquor bottles)
    
    5. **Model numbers**: Catalog or inventory numbers for particular bottle designs
    
    The meaning of numbers varies by manufacturer and era. For instance, on Owens-Illinois bottles (1929-1966), a two-digit number often represents the last two digits of the year, while a single digit to the left of the maker's mark indicates the plant location. Consulting manufacturer-specific resources helps decode these number systems accurately.
