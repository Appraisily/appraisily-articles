The value of Native American artifacts varies widely based on age, rarity, condition, provenance, and cultural significance. Understanding which types of artifacts typically command higher values can help you prioritize appraisal needs.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Stone Artifacts

Stone artifacts, particularly well-crafted points, blades, and tools, can be highly valuable. Rare examples like Cumberland points, Clovis points, and fluted points often command premium prices. According to [Heartland Artifacts](https://heartlandartifacts.com/identifying-value-of-native-american-artifacts/), factors affecting value include:

- Age (older typically means more valuable)
- Material quality (high-grade flint or obsidian)
- Craftsmanship and intricacy
- Size (especially for larger, intact examples)
- Provenance documentation

### Pottery and Ceramics

Native American pottery represents some of the most sought-after artifacts in the market. Particularly valuable are:

- Pre-Columbian pottery from Southwest cultures
- Historic-era pueblo pottery (Santa Clara, San Ildefonso)
- Pottery by known artists (Maria Martinez, Nampeyo)
- Pottery with intact decoration and minimal repairs
- Unusual forms or exceptionally large examples

### Textiles and Blankets

Navajo rugs and blankets represent a significant category in Native American art valuation, with prices ranging from a few hundred dollars to hundreds of thousands for exceptional examples. Key factors include:

- Age (pre-1900 examples command highest prices)
- Dye type (natural vs. commercial)
- Pattern complexity
- Size and condition
- Provenance

### Beadwork and Quillwork

Intricate beadwork and quillwork items, especially those from the 19th century, can be highly valuable. Items like moccasins, clothing, bags, and ceremonial objects with fine decorative work are particularly sought after.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Avoiding Scams and Unethical Practices" level="2" >}}
The market for Native American artifacts unfortunately attracts unscrupulous individuals. Being aware of common scams and knowing how to verify an appraiser's credentials can protect you from fraud and financial loss.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Red Flags to Watch For

Be wary of appraisers who:

1. **Offer to purchase items they're appraising** - This represents a conflict of interest
2. **Provide appraisals without physical examination** - Photos alone are insufficient for accurate authentication
3. **Cannot provide credentials or references** - Legitimate appraisers have verifiable qualifications
4. **Quote values significantly above market rates** - Inflated appraisals may be used for insurance fraud
5. **Pressure you to make quick decisions** - Professional appraisers respect your need for time and consideration

### Verifying Appraiser Qualifications

Before hiring an appraiser, verify their:

- **Professional membership** in recognized organizations (ISA, AAA, ASA)
- **Specialized training** in Native American artifacts
- **Client references** from previous appraisal work
- **Professional approach** to documentation and research
- **Transparent fee structure** disclosed upfront

### Questions to Ask Your Appraiser

4. What documentation should I maintain for insurance purposes?
5. Are there legal considerations regarding ownership or sale?

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Indian Artifacts Appraisals" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What kind of Indian artifacts are worth money?" >}}
    The most valuable Native American artifacts typically include:
    
    - **Stone Artifacts:** Particularly rare points like Clovis, Cumberland, and other fluted points
    - **Pottery:** Historic and pre-historic pottery, especially from Southwest cultures
    - **Textiles:** Navajo blankets and rugs, particularly chief's blankets and early wearing blankets

    - **Baskets:** Well-preserved examples from tribes known for basketry
    - **Metal and Silver Jewelry:** Historic pieces with fine turquoise and craftsmanship
    
    The highest values are typically associated with items that are pre-1900, in excellent condition, have documented provenance, and represent exceptional craftsmanship for their type.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I get an Indian blanket appraised?" >}}
    To get an Indian blanket (typically a Navajo rug or blanket) appraised:
    
    1. **Research specialized appraisers** - Look for experts who specifically list textile or Navajo weavings as a specialty
    2. **Contact a reputable gallery** - Establishments like Indian Territory offer free appraisals between 11am-4pm Tuesday through Saturday
    3. **Prepare documentation** - Gather any provenance information, including where and when it was acquired
    4. **Schedule an in-person evaluation** - Most textile appraisals require physical examination
    5. **Consider specialized appraisal events** - Museums and galleries sometimes host special appraisal days
    
    For valuable or historic blankets, seek appraisers with specific expertise in Native American textiles rather than general appraisers.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much does it cost to get Indian artifacts appraised?" >}}
    Appraisal costs for Indian artifacts vary based on several factors:
    
    - **Initial evaluations:** Some galleries offer free initial evaluations
    - **Single item appraisals:** Typically range from $125-$250 per item
    - **Written appraisal reports:** Comprehensive reports start around $350
    - **Hourly rates:** Professional appraisers typically charge $100-$250 per hour
    
    More complex or valuable collections, items requiring extensive research, or items needing formal documentation for insurance or legal purposes will cost more. Many appraisers offer both verbal consultations at lower rates and formal written appraisals at higher rates.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are there free Native American artifact appraisal services?" >}}
    Yes, there are several options for free initial appraisals of Native American artifacts:
    
    1. **Indian Territory Gallery** offers free evaluations of American Indian art with values for both insurance and current market purposes
    
    2. **Museum identification days** where experts volunteer to examine artifacts (though these typically don't provide monetary values)
    
    3. **Some auction houses** provide free evaluations when considering items for consignment
    
    4. **Online forums and groups** can provide informal assessments, though these should not be considered official appraisals
    
    Keep in mind that free appraisals are typically initial evaluations rather than formal documented appraisals. For insurance, legal, or high-value items, a paid professional appraisal is recommended.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if an Indian artifact is authentic?" >}}
    Authenticating Indian artifacts requires expertise, but these indicators can help:
    
    1. **Materials and techniques** - Authentic pieces use traditional materials and construction methods appropriate to their time period and tribal origin
    
    2. **Patina and wear** - Genuine artifacts show appropriate age-related wear patterns and patina that cannot be easily replicated
    
    3. **Provenance documentation** - Records of previous ownership, especially those tracing back decades
    
    4. **Stylistic consistency** - Details should match known examples from the same time period and tribal group
    
    5. **Construction details** - Hand-made aspects like irregular stitching, natural pigments, or tool marks
    
    For valuable or important pieces, always consult with a professional appraiser who specializes in Native American artifacts. Modern reproduction techniques have become sophisticated, making expert examination essential.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are there legal restrictions on buying or selling Indian artifacts?" >}}
    Yes, several important legal restrictions apply to Native American artifacts:
    
    1. **Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA)** - Prohibits excavation or removal of artifacts from federal or tribal lands without permits
    
    2. **Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA)** - Regulates items related to Native American human remains and certain cultural items
    
    3. **State laws** - Many states have additional protections for artifacts found within their boundaries
    
    4. **Indian Arts and Crafts Act** - Prohibits misrepresentation in marketing of Native American crafts
    
    5. **Export restrictions** - Some artifacts may be subject to export restrictions
    
    Legal ownership typically requires documented provenance showing the item was collected before protective legislation or obtained through legal channels. An appraiser can help identify potential legal issues with specific artifacts.
