Old Royal typewriters have become prized collectibles, with certain models fetching impressive sums in today's antique market. Whether you've inherited a vintage Royal or are considering adding one to your collection, understanding their value is essential. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the factors that determine old Royal typewriters' value, identify the most sought-after models, and provide current market price ranges to help you assess your machine's worth.

Founded in 1906, the Royal Typewriter Company produced some of the most innovative and reliable typewriters of the 20th century. Today, these mechanical marvels capture nostalgic fascination and historical significance that continues to drive their collectibility and value.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Royal Typewriter History & Value Overview" level="2" >}}
  Before assessing value, it's important to understand the rich history of Royal typewriters and what makes certain models particularly desirable to collectors.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The Royal Typewriter Company entered the market in March 1906 with its first machine, the Royal Standard. What set Royal apart from competitors was its innovative "flatbed" design, which provided greater stability and durability. By the 1930s, Royal had established itself as one of the "Big Four" typewriter manufacturers alongside Underwood, Remington, and Smith Corona.

Royal's popularity continued through the mid-20th century with groundbreaking models like the Royal Portable, the Royal Quiet De Luxe (famously used by Ernest Hemingway), and the Royal KMM. The company eventually merged with other manufacturers and transitioned to electric models before typewriters were largely replaced by word processors and computers.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors Affecting Royal Typewriter Value" level="2" >}}
  Multiple elements influence the market value of vintage Royal typewriters, from age and condition to rarity and aesthetic appeal.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

When determining an old Royal typewriter's worth, several key factors come into play:

### Age and Model

Generally, older Royal typewriters (especially pre-1940 models) tend to command higher prices. Early models from the 1910s and 1920s with glass keys and nickel plating are particularly valuable. Limited production models or those with special features can also significantly increase value.

### Condition

Condition dramatically impacts value, with fully functional, well-maintained machines worth substantially more than non-working or damaged examples.

  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Decals and badges present" / />}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### Rarity

Limited edition models, uncommon colors, and typewriters with unique features (like special key layouts or rare decals) can be worth significantly more than standard models.

### Aesthetics and Design

Some Royal models are simply more visually appealing than others. Art Deco styling, elegant glass keys, and attractive color schemes can boost collectibility and value.

### Historical Significance

Typewriters with documented connections to famous individuals or historical events can command premium prices. For instance, a Royal Quiet De Luxe known to have been used by a notable author would be substantially more valuable than an identical model without such provenance.

### Completeness

Original cases, manuals, cleaning tools, and other accessories add significant value to vintage Royal typewriters. A complete set in good condition is always worth more than the typewriter alone.

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Value Impact Factors" columns="3" / />}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Royal Typewriter Value By Era and Model" level="2" >}}
  Different periods of Royal typewriter production yield varying values in today's collectibles market.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

- Glass-topped keys
- Nickel-plated components
- Open frame designs

**Current Value Range:** Working examples in good condition typically sell for $800-$2,500, with rare variants or exceptionally preserved specimens potentially exceeding this range.

### Royal Portables (1926-1950)

### Mid-Century Models (1950s-1970s)

Royal typewriters from the post-war era, including the Royal Quiet De Luxe (later versions), Royal Safari, and Royal Futura, offer affordability for beginning collectors:

### Electric Models (1960s-1980s)

Later electric Royal typewriters generally have less collector appeal, but some models have developed niche followings:

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How to Identify Your Royal Typewriter Model" level="2" >}}
  Proper identification is crucial for determining your typewriter's age and potential value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

To accurately identify your Royal typewriter:

### Locate the Serial Number

The serial number is typically found on the frame under the right side of the carriage. In some portable models, you may need to lift the carriage or look underneath the machine.

### Use Online Databases

The Typewriter Database (typewriterdatabase.com) maintains serial number records for Royal typewriters that can help pinpoint manufacturing dates. According to a Reddit thread, "Take your serial number here, https://typewriterdatabase.com/royal.72.typewriter-serial-number-database, and look for your number within one of the ranges given to find the year."

### Identify Key Features

Different Royal models have distinctive characteristics:

- **Royal Standard/Royal 10**: Large upright models with visible mechanisms
- **Royal KHM/KMM**: Office models with "Magic Margin" feature
- **Royal Portable**: Compact clamshell case when closed
- **Royal Quiet De Luxe**: Sleek design with "Quiet" badging
- **Royal Safari/Futura**: More modern, colorful designs from the 50s-60s

### Check for Special Features

Look for distinctive Royal innovations that can help with dating and identification:

- Touch Control (introduced in the 1930s)
- Magic Margin (introduced in late 1930s)
- Twin-Pak ribbon system (post-WWII feature)
- Finger-Flow keys (featured on later models)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Where to Buy and Sell Royal Typewriters" level="2" >}}
  Various marketplaces cater to buyers and sellers of vintage typewriters, each with advantages and considerations.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

When looking to purchase or sell a Royal typewriter, consider these venues:

### Online Marketplaces

**eBay** remains one of the most active markets for vintage typewriters. According to their collectible typewriters section, Royal typewriters range widely in price. The "Royal 79101T Classic Manual Typewriter - Mint Green" sells for $216.97 new, while genuine vintage models vary based on age and condition.

**Etsy** offers many restored and collectible Royal typewriters, often at premium prices reflecting the seller's restoration work.

**1stDibs** and other high-end antique platforms typically feature more valuable Royal models, with prices averaging around $450 according to their site data.

### Specialty Dealers

Dedicated typewriter shops and restorers offer expertly refurbished machines, often with warranties. These typically command higher prices but provide greater assurance of functionality.

### Antique Stores and Estate Sales

These can be excellent sources for finding undervalued Royal typewriters, though condition may be uncertain.

### Collector Forums and Groups

Facebook groups like "What's My Typewriter Worth?" provide community valuation assistance and sometimes direct buying/selling opportunities.

For rare or historically significant Royal typewriters, established auction houses may yield the highest returns for sellers.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Restoration and Maintenance" level="2" >}}
  Proper care and strategic restoration can significantly impact your Royal typewriter's value and functionality.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Value Considerations

While a fully functional Royal typewriter is worth more than a non-working one, improper restoration can actually decrease value. Consider these guidelines:

- Professional restoration of mechanisms can increase value by $75-$100 or more
- Original paint should be preserved when possible
- Replacement parts should be period-appropriate
- Extensive modifications or non-authentic "customizations" typically decrease collector value

### Basic Maintenance Tips

For Royal typewriter owners:

1. **Cleaning**: Use compressed air, soft brushes, and minimal moisture to remove dust and debris
2. **Lubrication**: Apply appropriate oils sparingly only to moving metal parts
3. **Ribbon Replacement**: Install new ribbons for usability, but preserve original spools
4. **Storage**: Keep in dry environments with dust covers to prevent deterioration
5. **Case Care**: Clean and condition leather or fabric cases to prevent breakdown

### Professional Restoration

For valuable models or extensively damaged machines, professional restoration by typewriter specialists is recommended. This typically costs $150-$300 but can significantly increase both functionality and value.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Royal Typewriter Values" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell how old my Royal Typewriter is?" >}}
    The most reliable method is using the serial number. Locate the serial number on the frame under the right end of the carriage and reference it against the Royal typewriter serial number database at typewriterdatabase.com. This will help you identify the manufacturing year within a specific range. Additional clues include the presence of glass keys (generally pre-1940s), the Touch Control feature (introduced in the 1930s), and the overall design style.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What year did Royal Typewriter come out?" >}}
    The Royal Typewriter Company was founded in 1904, and the first Royal typewriter model, the Royal Standard, was sold in March 1906. This initial offering featured the company's innovative "flatbed" design that distinguished it from competitors. The company continued producing typewriters until the 1970s, when it was acquired by Litton Industries and eventually phased out traditional typewriter production.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How old does a typewriter have to be to be considered an antique?" >}}
    By the traditional definition used in the United States, an item must be at least 100 years old to be classified as a true antique. This means Royal typewriters from 1906 through the early 1920s would currently qualify as genuine antiques. However, in the collector market, typewriters from the 1920s through 1950s are often referred to as "vintage" and can still be quite valuable. Machines from the 1960s-1970s are generally considered "collectible" rather than antique.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the most valuable Royal typewriter model?" >}}
    The most valuable Royal typewriters are typically early examples with unique features or historical significance. These include:
    
    1. Early Royal Standard models from 1906-1910
    2. Limited edition Royal Quiet De Luxe models (particularly the gold-plated version)
    3. Rare colored models from any era (especially pink, red, or custom colors)
    4. Models with documented provenance connected to famous writers or historical events
    5. Pristine examples with original cases and accessories
    
    In exceptional cases, these rare models can sell for $2,000-$5,000 or more.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is my 1950s Royal typewriter worth anything?" >}}
    Yes, 1950s Royal typewriters do have value in today's collector market. According to experts on Quora, a typical 1950s Royal in functional but unrestored condition might fetch $50-$100. If the typewriter has been professionally reconditioned, you can expect $125-$175 or more. Factors that can increase the value of a 1950s Royal include:
    
    - Uncommon colors (especially pink, red, or teal)
    - Complete original case and accessories
    - Mint condition with minimal wear
    - Working condition with all features functioning
    
    Popular 1950s models like the Royal Quiet De Luxe and Royal Safari in excellent condition can sell for $200-$500, particularly if they have attractive colors or special features.

### Starting a Collection

If you're new to collecting Royal typewriters:

1. **Begin with later models**: Mid-century Royals (1950s-60s) offer affordability and availability
2. **Focus on condition**: Prioritize working machines over non-functional project pieces
3. **Consider space requirements**: Typewriters require significant display and storage space
4. **Learn basic maintenance**: Understanding simple cleaning and maintenance will protect your investment

### Collection Focus Ideas

Consider specializing your Royal collection around themes:

- **Professional vs. consumer**: Contrasting office models with home-use machines

### Investment Potential

While collecting should primarily be driven by passion, some Royal typewriters do appreciate in value:

- Early models (pre-1940) continue to increase in value as they become scarcer
- Unusual colors maintain strong demand among collectors
- Professionally restored machines in working condition hold value better than non-functional examples
- Complete sets with cases and accessories appreciate more reliably than typewriters alone
