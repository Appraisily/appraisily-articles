Identifying genuine antique bricks requires attention to several key characteristics that distinguish them from modern reproductions. Here's what to look for when examining a potentially valuable antique brick.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Collection of vintage bricks showing various textures and makers marks](https://i.redd.it/are-saving-these-old-bricks-worth-it-v0-byk754x2tmbb1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5003c3670c7d4617a25cfc44e30a41ac69121d17)

### Dimensions and Proportions

Antique bricks typically have different dimensions than modern bricks. Most handmade bricks from the 18th and 19th centuries were larger than today's standard bricks. Common dimensions for antique American bricks include:

- Colonial period (pre-1800): Approximately 8-9" × 4" × 2.5"
- 19th century: Approximately 8" × 3.75" × 2.25" 
- Early 20th century: Gradually standardizing toward modern dimensions

### Manufacturing Evidence

Look for clear signs of hand manufacturing:

- Finger impressions or hand marks
- Irregular edges and uneven surfaces
- "Frog" indentations (hollowed areas on one side)
- Sand-struck textures on surfaces
- Uneven coloration due to kiln positioning

### Material Composition

Examine the material composition:

- Antique bricks often contain visible impurities such as small stones, vegetable matter, or air pockets
- Regional variations in clay color—from deep reds to salmon, yellow, and even purple tints
- Denser, heavier composition than modern bricks due to manufacturing methods
- Varied internal texture when examining broken sections

### Surface Texture

Modern bricks are often wire-cut, giving them a rougher, more uniform texture. Historic bricks were typically box-formed, making them smoother but more inconsistent in shape. The texture difference is a key indicator when identifying historic brickwork.

### Weathering Patterns

Genuine antique bricks show authentic aging patterns that are difficult to falsify:

- Natural erosion patterns that reflect decades or centuries of exposure
- Authentic patina development
- Moss or lichen growth patterns consistent with age
- Mortar lines and wear patterns that match historical building techniques
