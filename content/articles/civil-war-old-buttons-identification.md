{{< content-modules/section-header title="Introduction to Civil War Buttons" level="2" >}}
Civil War buttons are among the most collectible and historically significant military artifacts from America's defining conflict. These small metal relics served both functional and symbolic purposes on military uniforms from 1861-1865, representing regiment, branch, rank, and allegiance. For collectors, metal detectorists, and history enthusiasts, understanding how to properly identify these buttons is essential for determining authenticity, historical context, and value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Various Civil War buttons including Union eagle designs and Confederate state buttons](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/civil-war-old-buttons-identification/civil-war-old-buttons-identification-image-1_RfpBrrxHT.png)

Civil War buttons continue to be discovered today, whether through archaeological digs at battle sites, metal detecting in historic areas, or among family heirlooms passed down through generations. This comprehensive guide will help you identify authentic Civil War buttons, understand their historical significance, and determine their potential value in today's collector's market.

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Civil War Button Facts" columns="3" / /  >}}
- Union forces used over 10 million uniform buttons during the war
- Confederate buttons are typically 10-15x rarer than Union examples
- Well-preserved buttons with backmarks can sell for $50-$2,500+
- Most Civil War buttons were made of brass or gilt brass
- Over 3,000 different button designs existed during the Civil War era

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Materials and Manufacturing" level="2" >}}
Understanding the materials and manufacturing techniques used for Civil War buttons is the first step in proper identification. These characteristics can help distinguish authentic period buttons from later reproductions.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Most Civil War buttons were made from brass, a durable alloy of copper and zinc. While brass was the predominant material, you might also encounter:

- **Gilt Brass**: Brass buttons with a thin gold wash for officers
- **Pewter**: Used for some Confederate buttons due to material shortages
- **Silver**: Rare, typically only for high-ranking officers
- **Iron**: Occasionally used for Confederate buttons late in the war

![Close-up of Civil War button showing brass construction and backmark](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/civil-war-old-buttons-identification/civil-war-old-buttons-identification-image-2_vxqrJEM9p.png)

The manufacturing process typically involved:

1. Stamping the design onto a brass disk
2. Adding a shank (attachment loop) to the back
3. Applying plating or wash if required (for officer buttons)
4. Adding a manufacturer's backmark (on most Union and some Confederate buttons)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Union Button Identification" level="2" >}}
Union buttons are more common than their Confederate counterparts and feature distinctive designs that make them relatively straightforward to identify.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Federal Eagle Designs

The most common Union button design features an eagle with spread wings. These eagle buttons typically include:

- An eagle with a shield on its breast
- Wings spread in a horizontal or upward position
- Often clutching arrows or an olive branch
- "E Pluribus Unum" on a ribbon (on some designs)

Different branches of service had specific eagle designs:

- **Infantry**: Eagle facing left with shield and arrows
- **Artillery**: Eagle with crossed cannons below
- **Cavalry**: Eagle with crossed sabers or the letter "C"
- **Navy**: Eagle facing left standing on a horizontal anchor

### State Buttons

Union state buttons featured state-specific designs and were worn by state militia units. Common examples include:

- New York: State seal with "Excelsior" motto
- Massachusetts: Arm holding sword with Latin motto
- Pennsylvania: State coat of arms with horses
- Connecticut: Grapevines with Latin motto

### Button Sizes and Purposes

Civil War buttons came in different sizes for different uniform positions:

- **Coat Size**: Large buttons, approximately 22-23mm in diameter
- **Cuff Size**: Smaller buttons, approximately 14-15mm in diameter
- **Vest Size**: Medium buttons, approximately 18-19mm in diameter

### Backmarks

One of the most important identification features of authentic Union buttons is the backmark - a manufacturer's stamp on the reverse side. Common Civil War-era manufacturers include:

- Scovill Manufacturing Co.
- Waterbury Button Co.
- Horstmann & Sons
- W.H. Smith

Backmarks often include the manufacturer's name, location, and sometimes quality indicators like "EXTRA QUALITY" or "TREBLE GILT."

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Confederate Button Identification" level="2" >}}
Confederate buttons are generally rarer and more valuable than Union examples due to lower production numbers and the South's limited manufacturing capabilities during the war.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Confederate Design Types

Confederate buttons fall into several categories:

- **Block "I"**: Worn by Confederate Infantry
- **Block "A"**: Worn by Confederate Artillery
- **Block "C"**: Worn by Confederate Cavalry
- **State Seal Buttons**: Featuring designs from Southern states
- **CSA Buttons**: Featuring the letters "CSA" in various designs
- **Star Buttons**: Featuring stars representing the Confederacy

### Confederate State Buttons

Confederate state buttons are highly prized by collectors and feature designs specific to Southern states:

- Alabama: State coat of arms with "ALABAMA" text
- Georgia: State seal with pillars and arch
- North Carolina: State capitol building
- South Carolina: Palmetto tree and crescent
- Virginia: Standing figure with spear and "SICA SEMPER TYRANNIS"

![Confederate cavalry C button with chocolate brown patina](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/civil-war-old-buttons-identification/civil-war-old-buttons-identification-image-4_8kQ4EvhnbY.png)

### Confederate Button Manufacturers

Due to the Union blockade, the Confederacy relied heavily on imported buttons and local manufacturing. Look for these backmarks on Confederate buttons:

- S.B. Smith & Co. (Charleston)
- P. Tait & Co. (Limerick, Ireland)
- Courtney & Tennent (Charleston)
- Hyde & Goodrich (New Orleans)

Many Confederate buttons lack backmarks entirely, especially those made later in the war when materials were scarce.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Dating and Authenticating Civil War Buttons" level="2" >}}
Properly dating and authenticating Civil War buttons requires careful examination of multiple characteristics.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Visual Examination

Begin with a visual inspection looking for:

- **Appropriate Patina**: Civil War buttons should have a natural aged appearance
- **Wear Patterns**: Look for authentic wear consistent with age and use
- **Shank Style**: Wire shanks or cast-in-place shanks are typical of the period
- **Design Details**: Compare to known authentic examples in reference books

{{< interactive-modules/condition-checklist title="Authentication Checklist" description="Check these factors when authenticating Civil War buttons" >}}
{{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Button shows appropriate patina for its age (150+ years)" /  >}}

{{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Weight and thickness consistent with period examples" /  >}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### Backmark Analysis

Backmarks are crucial for authentication:

- Research the manufacturer to confirm they were operating during the Civil War
- Compare the exact backmark style to reference guides
- Look for appropriate font styles and text layouts consistent with the period

### Context and Provenance

The button's discovery context can provide important authentication clues:

- Buttons found at documented Civil War sites have higher likelihood of authenticity
- Family heirlooms with documented provenance are more trustworthy
- Collections with established provenance may contain authentic examples

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Common Reproduction Warning Signs" level="2" >}}
The market is unfortunately filled with modern reproductions. Here's how to spot them:
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

1. **Machine-made Shanks**: Modern machine-made shanks look different from hand-attached period examples
2. **Artificial Patina**: Chemical treatments used to simulate age often have an unnatural appearance
3. **Incorrect Backmarks**: Reproductions may have inaccurate or fantasy backmarks
4. **Wrong Materials**: Modern alloys have different compositions than 19th-century brass
5. **Casting Flaws**: Many reproductions are cast from original buttons and show loss of detail

{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Cleaning Considerations

The most important rule for Civil War button preservation is: **less is more**. Never aggressively clean historic buttons, as their patina is part of their value and authenticity.

For buttons discovered through metal detecting:

1. Gently rinse with distilled water to remove soil
2. Allow to air dry completely
3. Use a soft brush (like a toothbrush) for stubborn dirt
4. NEVER use metal polishes, chemical cleaners, or abrasives

For buttons from collections or family heirlooms:

1. Avoid cleaning if the button is stable
2. Handle with clean cotton gloves or clean hands
3. If necessary, dust with a very soft brush
4. Store properly to prevent further deterioration

### Storage Recommendations

Proper storage will help preserve your buttons for generations:

- Use acid-free paper or archival containers
- Store in a climate-controlled environment
- Avoid plastic containers that can trap moisture
- Consider individual coin holders for valuable specimens
- Keep detailed records of provenance and acquisition information

Many Civil War buttons are still being discovered today through responsible metal detecting at historical sites.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

If you're interested in searching for Civil War buttons through metal detecting, keep these important considerations in mind:

1. **Research and Permissions**: Always obtain proper permissions and permits. Never detect on protected battlefields or national parks without authorization.

2. **Equipment Selection**: Use a metal detector with good discrimination capabilities that can distinguish between button materials and other metals.

3. **Responsible Recovery**: Use minimally invasive techniques to recover artifacts, and always fill your holes.

4. **Documentation**: Record precise GPS coordinates and context of each find.

5. **Legal Considerations**: Familiarize yourself with local, state, and federal laws regarding artifact recovery and ownership.

6. **Archaeological Ethics**: Consider working with professional archaeologists or historical societies to ensure your finds contribute to historical knowledge.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Civil War Button Identification" id="civil-war-button-faq" >}}
{{< content-modules/faq-item question="What were Civil War buttons made of?" >}}
Civil War buttons were primarily made of brass, a copper and zinc alloy. Union buttons were typically high-quality gilt brass, while Confederate buttons varied more in materials due to Southern supply shortages. As the war progressed, Confederate buttons sometimes used iron, pewter, or whatever metals were available. Officers' buttons in both armies might be higher quality with gold plating or gilding, while enlisted men's buttons were generally ungilded brass.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="Did Waterbury make Confederate buttons?" >}}
Yes, Waterbury Button Company did produce buttons that ended up being used by Confederate forces, although not directly. Before the Civil War began, Waterbury was a major button supplier to Southern states. When the war broke out, the Union blockade prevented direct shipments, but Waterbury buttons still reached the Confederacy through intermediaries in Europe. According to Waterbury's own company history, "The South uses intermediaries in Europe to obtain Waterbury buttons for its troops." However, most Confederate buttons came from Southern manufacturers or were imported from England and Ireland.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if a Civil War button is authentic?" >}}
Authenticating Civil War buttons involves examining several key characteristics:

1. Backmarks: Check if the manufacturer's mark matches known Civil War-era companies.
2. Material composition: Period buttons should be brass or another period-appropriate metal.
3. Shank style: Civil War buttons typically have loop shanks that were hand-soldered.
4. Patina: Authentic buttons have a natural aged patina, not a chemical or artificial appearance.
5. Design details: Compare to reference books for accurate period designs.
6. Weight and thickness: Reproductions are often heavier than originals.

Consulting with experienced collectors or professional appraisers is recommended for valuable or rare examples.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="What's the value of a Civil War button?" >}}
Civil War button values vary widely based on several factors:

- Type: Confederate buttons generally command higher prices than Union buttons
- Rarity: Unusual units or limited production buttons fetch premium prices
- Condition: Well-preserved examples with clear details are worth more
- Provenance: Buttons with documented history can be more valuable
- Backmark: Buttons with clear manufacturer marks tend to be worth more

Typical price ranges:
- Common Union eagle buttons: $35-$150
- Union state buttons: $75-$300
- Confederate general service buttons: $300-$1,200
- Confederate state buttons: $250-$2,500+
- Rare Confederate naval buttons: Up to $3,000 or more

Prices continue to rise as these artifacts become increasingly scarce.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where can I find Civil War buttons?" >}}
Civil War buttons can be found through various sources:

1. Metal detecting at historically documented Civil War sites (with proper permissions)
2. Antique shops specializing in militaria
3. Civil War collector shows and relic exhibitions
4. Online auction sites like eBay (exercise caution regarding authenticity)
5. Specialized Civil War artifact dealers
6. Estate sales in areas with Civil War history
7. Inheritance from family with Civil War connections

Remember that buttons found on federal lands like National Battlefields are protected by law and cannot be legally collected. Always research local, state, and federal regulations before metal detecting.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="How should I clean a Civil War button I found?" >}}
The cardinal rule for Civil War buttons is minimal intervention. For newly discovered buttons:

1. Gently rinse with distilled water to remove loose dirt
2. Use a soft brush (like a soft toothbrush) if necessary
3. Allow to air dry completely
4. NEVER use metal polishes, chemicals, or abrasive cleaners
5. Do not attempt to polish or restore the original shine
6. Preserve the patina as it's considered part of the button's value and authenticity

Remember that improper cleaning can dramatically reduce a button's value. When in doubt, consult with a professional conservator, especially for rare or valuable specimens.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="What are the most common Union Army button designs?" >}}
The most common Union Army button designs include:

1. General Service Eagle: Eagle with shield on breast, spread wings, usually holding arrows and olive branch
2. Infantry: Eagle design with "I" script below
3. Cavalry: Eagle design with "C" script or crossed sabers below
4. Artillery: Eagle design with crossed cannons below
5. State buttons: Featuring state seals and symbols from Northern states
