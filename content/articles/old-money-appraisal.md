          '@type': Answer
          text: >-
            Old paper money can have four primary types of value: 1) Face Value
            - The printed denomination on the bill (what you could spend it
            for), 2) Book Value - The average dealer retail price for that
            particular note, 3) Wholesale Value - The price dealers might pay to
            acquire the note (typically 60-80% of book value), and 4) Auction
            Value - The price the note might bring at auction, which can vary
            widely based on bidding interest.

        name: What factors make old currency valuable?
        acceptedAnswer:
          '@type': Answer
          text: >-
            The main factors that make old currency valuable are: Rarity
            (scarcity of a particular note, limited print runs, discontinued
            series, or bills that were mostly destroyed or recalled), Condition
            (physical state rated from 'Poor' to 'Gem Uncirculated'), and
            Historical Significance (currency from significant historical
            periods or with unique historical connections, including Confederate
            currency, notes from banking crises, or special wartime issues).

Have you discovered old paper money tucked away in an attic, inherited from a relative, or found in a forgotten wallet? That weathered currency might be worth significantly more than its face value. Understanding how to properly appraise old money can be the difference between spending a rare bill at face value and discovering a valuable collector's item.

![Collection of rare and antique paper currency being examined for appraisal](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-money-appraisal/old-money-appraisal-image-1_3sjmKUmX4.png)

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about old money appraisal – from identifying potentially valuable currency to finding reputable appraisers and understanding the factors that determine a bill's worth in today's collector's market.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Understanding the Value of Old Currency" level="2" >}}
Before seeking an appraisal, it's helpful to understand that old paper money can have several different types of "value" that may exceed its face amount.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

There are four primary types of value when it comes to old currency:

1. **Face Value** - The printed denomination on the bill (what you could spend it for)
2. **Book Value** - The average dealer retail price for that particular note
3. **Wholesale Value** - The price dealers might pay to acquire the note (typically 60-80% of book value)
4. **Auction Value** - The price the note might bring at auction, which can vary widely based on bidding interest

![Various rare bills and currency examples showing different denominations and types](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-money-appraisal/old-money-appraisal-image-2_9sshub73Q.png)

Just because a bill is old doesn't automatically make it valuable. However, certain factors can significantly increase a note's worth to collectors and investors.

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Key Factors Affecting Old Money Value" columns="3" / /  >}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors That Make Old Currency Valuable" level="3" >}}
Understanding what makes old money valuable can help you identify potentially significant items in your collection.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Rarity
The scarcity of a particular note is perhaps the most crucial factor in determining its worth. Limited print runs, discontinued series, or bills that were mostly destroyed or recalled are typically more valuable.

### Condition
The physical state of your currency dramatically impacts its value. Professional graders use a detailed scale ranging from "Poor" (heavily damaged) to "Gem Uncirculated" (pristine condition with no signs of wear).

### Historical Significance
Currency from significant historical periods or with unique historical connections often commands premium prices. This includes Confederate currency, notes from the banking crises, or special wartime issues.

### Errors & Varieties
Bills with printing errors or special characteristics can be extremely valuable. These include:
- Misaligned printing
- Missing serial numbers
- Ink errors
- Wrong paper use
- Cutting errors

### Serial Numbers
Certain serial numbers can significantly enhance value:
- Solid numbers (e.g., 88888888)
- Ladders (e.g., 12345678)
- Low numbers (e.g., 00000001)
- Binary numbers (only 0s and 1s)
- Radar/palindrome numbers (same forward and backward)

![Detailed close-up of rare currency showing serial numbers and special markings](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-money-appraisal/old-money-appraisal-image-3_o7EFhQtBS.png)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Types of Collectible Currency" level="2" >}}
Various types of currency attract different levels of collector interest and can have vastly different values.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Large Size Notes (Pre-1929)
Often called "horseblankets" for their larger size, these notes were standard currency until 1929. They include:
- Silver Certificates
- Gold Certificates
- Treasury Notes
- Federal Reserve Notes
- National Bank Notes

### Small Size Notes (1929-Present)
The familiar size of modern currency, these notes include several collectible categories:
- Silver Certificates
- Gold Certificates
- Red Seal United States Notes
- Brown Seal Federal Reserve Notes
- Star Notes (replacement notes with a star in the serial number)

### National Bank Notes
From 1863 to 1935, thousands of national banks issued their own currency backed by U.S. bonds. These notes, which bear the issuing bank's name, are highly collectible—especially from small towns or banks that issued limited quantities.

### Confederate & Obsolete Currency
Notes issued by the Confederate States during the Civil War and obsolete currency issued by states, cities, and private banks before federal regulation can be quite valuable to collectors of historical paper money.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Online Appraisal Options" level="3" >}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Understanding Currency Grading" level="2" >}}
Professional currency grading is a standardized way to assess a note's condition, which significantly impacts its value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### The Sheldon Scale for Currency
Most professional graders use a 70-point scale adapted from coin grading:

- **Poor (P-1)**: Extremely worn, may have pieces missing
- **Fair (FR-2)**: Heavy circulation, may have tears or stains
- **About Good (AG-3)**: Very heavy circulation, intact but worn
- **Good (G-4 to G-6)**: Heavy circulation but all features visible
- **Very Good (VG-8 to VG-10)**: Well circulated but cleaner appearance
- **Fine (F-12 to F-15)**: Moderate circulation, some creasing
- **Very Fine (VF-20 to VF-35)**: Light to moderate circulation
- **Extremely Fine (EF/XF-40 to EF/XF-45)**: Light circulation, minimal creasing
- **About Uncirculated (AU-50 to AU-58)**: Minimal signs of handling
- **Uncirculated (MS/CU-60 to MS/CU-70)**: No circulation, ranging from obvious flaws to perfect condition

A difference of just a few grade points can sometimes double or triple a note's value, especially in the higher grades.

### The Appraisal Process
A thorough currency appraisal typically includes:

1. **Authentication** - Verifying the note is genuine, not counterfeit or altered

3. **Grading** - Assessing the condition using standardized criteria
4. **Market Research** - Comparing to recent sales of similar items

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Red Flags to Watch For" level="3" >}}
Protect yourself from unscrupulous dealers and inaccurate appraisals by watching for these warning signs.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

- **Immediate offers to buy** without thoroughly examining the item

- **Vague or overly broad statements** about value
- **No references** or verifiable credentials
- **Unusually high appraisal values** followed by low purchase offers

- **No explanation** of how values were determined
- **Refusal to consider getting a second opinion**

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Do-It-Yourself Value Research" level="2" >}}
Before seeking professional appraisal, you can conduct some preliminary research yourself.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Reference Materials
Several excellent resources can help you research your currency:
- **Standard Catalog of United States Paper Money** by Krause Publications
- **Paper Money of the United States** by Arthur and Ira Friedberg
- **The Comprehensive Catalog of U.S. Paper Money** by Gene Hessler

### Online Price Archives
Review recent auction results to gauge current market values:
- [Heritage Auctions Archives](https://currency.ha.com/worth/currency-value.s)
- [Stack's Bowers Archives](https://auctions.stacksbowers.com/past_auctions/5)
- [PCGS Banknote Price Guide](https://www.pcgsbanknote.com/priceguide)

### Serial Number Research
Check your notes' serial numbers against databases of known valuable combinations:

- Special patterns like radars, ladders, and solid numbers
- Low-number notes (under 100)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Selling Your Old Currency" level="2" >}}
If your appraisal reveals valuable items you wish to sell, several options are available.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Dealer Sales
Selling to established currency dealers offers several advantages:
- Immediate payment
- No additional fees or commissions
- Simplicity and convenience
- However, expect wholesale prices (typically 60-80% of retail value)

### Auction Houses
Major auction houses specializing in currency can often achieve higher prices:
- Potential to reach serious collectors worldwide
- Professional marketing of your items
- Expert cataloging and photography
- However, they charge seller's fees (typically 10-20% of the hammer price)

### Direct to Collectors
Online platforms and collector forums allow direct sales:
- eBay (with detailed descriptions and clear photos)
- Specialized currency sales sites like [Old Currency Values](https://oldcurrencyvalues.com/)
- Currency collector forums and Facebook groups
- This approach can yield retail prices but requires more effort and knowledge

### Online Marketplaces
Several specialized marketplaces cater to currency collectors:
- [Currency Exchange](https://www.thecurrencyexchange.com/)
- [CoinZip](https://www.coinzip.com/)
- These platforms connect sellers with buyers but charge listing or commission fees

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Preservation Tips for Paper Currency" level="2" >}}
Proper storage and handling are essential to preserve the value of collectible currency.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Storage Solutions
Use appropriate archival-quality products:
- **Currency sleeves** - Use non-PVC, acid-free plastic sleeves
- **Album pages** - Currency-specific pages with pockets properly sized for bills
- **Portfolio binders** - Acid-free binders to hold album pages
- **Currency holders** - Semi-rigid holders for added protection

### Handling Guidelines
Follow these best practices:
- **Clean, dry hands** - Always wash and dry hands before handling, or use cotton gloves
- **Work surface** - Use a clean, soft surface free from food, drinks, or other contaminants
- **Support the note** - Always support the entire note when handling
- **Minimal touching** - Hold notes by the edges whenever possible
- **No repairs** - Never use tape, glue, or other materials to repair tears

### Environmental Factors
Control these conditions to prevent deterioration:
- **Temperature** - Keep between 65-72°F (18-22°C)
- **Humidity** - Maintain 40-50% relative humidity
- **Light exposure** - Minimize exposure to UV and bright light
- **Air quality** - Avoid smoke, cooking fumes, and industrial pollutants

### What to Avoid
These common mistakes can permanently damage collectible currency:
- **Folding or creasing** notes
- **Writing on currency** (even in pencil)
- **Using paperclips or staples**
- **Laminating** notes (ruins collectible value)
- **Cleaning with chemicals** or erasers
- **Storing in attics, basements, or garages**

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Old Money Appraisal" id="old-money-appraisal-faq" >}}
{{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I get old money appraised?" >}}
You have several options for getting old currency appraised:

1. Professional currency dealers who specialize in paper money
2. Auction houses like Heritage Auctions that offer free appraisals for potential auction items
3. Grading services such as PMG (Paper Money Guaranty)
4. Currency shows where multiple dealers can examine your items
5. Online appraisal services where you submit photos

For the most accurate appraisal, seek out a dealer who belongs to professional organizations like the American Numismatic Association or the Professional Currency Dealers Association.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes old paper money valuable?" >}}
Several factors determine the value of old paper money:

- **Rarity**: How many examples still exist
- **Condition**: The physical state of preservation
- **Historical significance**: Connection to important events or periods
- **Type and denomination**: Some types and higher denominations are inherently more valuable
- **Errors and varieties**: Notes with printing mistakes or special characteristics
- **Serial numbers**: Special patterns like solid numbers or low numbers
- **Demand from collectors**: Popularity among collectors for certain issues

Some common bills may be worth only face value despite their age, while others can be worth thousands due to these factors.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my old money has value?" >}}
To identify potentially valuable old money:

1. Check the date and type (Silver Certificate, Gold Certificate, National Bank Note, etc.)
2. Look for star symbols in the serial number (indicates a replacement note)
3. Note any unusual serial number patterns (low numbers, repeated digits, etc.)
4. Check for printing errors or oddities
5. Research the condition compared to grading standards
6. Look up similar notes in price guides or recent auction results
7. Examine for bank names on National Bank Notes, which can be valuable if from small towns

Remember that most modern notes (post-1960s) are usually only worth face value unless they have special characteristics.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where can I find a reputable currency appraiser near me?" >}}
To find a reputable currency appraiser in your area:

1. Search the American Numismatic Association's [dealer directory](https://www.money.org/dealer-directory)
2. Check the Professional Currency Dealers Association membership list
3. Contact major auction houses like Heritage Auctions or Stack's Bowers for recommendations
4. Visit established coin shops that also deal in paper money
5. Attend local coin and currency shows to meet dealers
6. Ask for recommendations in collector forums or groups

Always check credentials, request references, and consider getting multiple opinions for valuable items.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much does a professional currency appraisal cost?" >}}
Appraisal costs vary depending on the service and scope:

- **Free appraisals**: Many dealers offer free verbal appraisals, especially if you're considering selling to them
- **Auction house appraisals**: Often free for items they might auction
- **Written appraisals**: Typically $50-$200 for basic documentation
- **Insurance or estate appraisals**: Usually $75-$250 per hour
- **Professional grading services**: $15-$100+ per note depending on value and service level

For valuable collections, formal written appraisals may cost several hundred dollars but provide detailed documentation useful for insurance or estate purposes.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="Can I appraise old money online?" >}}
Yes, several online options exist for appraising old money:

1. Submit photos to online appraisal services like Heritage Auctions' [free appraisal service](https://currency.ha.com/free-appraisals.s)
2. Post clear images on collector forums like [Paper Money Forum](https://www.papermoneyforum.com/) or Reddit's r/papermoney
3. Use online price guides like the PMG Price Guide to research similar notes
4. Check completed auction listings on sites like Heritage or eBay for comparable sales
5. Use specialized apps designed for currency identification and preliminary valuation

Online appraisals provide good starting estimates, but for high-value items, an in-person evaluation by an expert is still recommended.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="Will cleaning old paper money increase its value?" >}}
No, cleaning old paper money will almost always decrease its value, sometimes dramatically. Professional collectors and dealers prefer original condition, even with some dirt or age toning.

Cleaning can:
- Remove the original "patina" that collectors expect
- Damage the paper fibers
- Create an unnatural appearance
- Be detected by experienced dealers and graders
- Result in significantly lower grades from professional services

If you have dirty currency, leave it as is and let a professional appraise it in its current condition. The only exception might be very gentle removal of loose surface dirt by a conservation professional for extremely valuable notes.

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="What are star notes and why are they valuable?" >}}
Star notes are replacement notes printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to replace notes with printing errors detected during production. They have a star symbol (★) at the end or beginning of the serial number.

They're valuable because:
- Fewer star notes are printed than regular notes
- They represent a small percentage of total currency
- Older star notes are particularly scarce
- Condition plays a major role in their value
- Some series have extremely limited star note production

Star notes from the 1920s-1950s can be worth significant premiums, while modern star notes might sell for 1.5 to 5 times face value depending on condition and rarity.
