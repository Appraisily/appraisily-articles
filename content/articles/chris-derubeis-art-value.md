Chris DeRubeis has established himself as a revolutionary figure in contemporary art through his groundbreaking technique known as "Abstract Sensualism®." Born in 1978, DeRubeis has gained international recognition for his unique approach to creating art on metal surfaces. His innovative use of metals like aluminum, steel, and copper as canvases, combined with proprietary techniques involving chemicals, power tools, and natural elements, has captivated collectors worldwide.

The value of DeRubeis' art stems from his technical mastery and the emotional depth his pieces evoke. By transforming rigid metal into flowing, organic forms with reflective surfaces that interact with light, DeRubeis creates artworks that change appearance depending on viewing angle and lighting conditions.

## The Artist and His Technique

![A modern art gallery showcasing a large Chris DeRubeis metal painting as centerpiece with art patrons viewing the work](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/chris-derubeis-art-value/chris-derubeis-art-value-image-2_CeAwm3xGx.png)

Chris DeRubeis began his artistic journey in Southern California, showing talent from an early age. By 13, he was using his grandfather's airbrush to paint motorcycles—a formative experience that would later influence his signature style. DeRubeis attended the Pasadena Art Center and Associates in Art school, funding his education through custom Harley-Davidson paintings.

His breakthrough came in the early 2000s when he discovered the unique effects created by grinding metal surfaces. This discovery led to the development of "Abstract Sensualism®," a term DeRubeis coined to describe his distinctive artistic approach.

DeRubeis' technique is labor-intensive and requires considerable skill. He works with various metals, using power tools to create textured surfaces before applying chemicals that react with the metal to produce unique color patterns. The artist then manipulates these reactions using fire, ice, and other elements to achieve his desired effects. Finally, protective coatings are applied to preserve the artwork.

This complex, multi-step process ensures that no two DeRubeis pieces are identical, contributing significantly to their value and collectibility. His technical innovation has been recognized as groundbreaking in the contemporary art world, with his works described as a fusion of painting and sculpture.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors Affecting DeRubeis Art Value" level="2" >}}
  Several key factors influence the market value of Chris DeRubeis artworks, from material composition to size and provenance.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The value of Chris DeRubeis' artwork is determined by multiple factors, with each playing a significant role in the final pricing:

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Key Value Determinants" columns="3" / / />}}

### 1. Material and Composition

DeRubeis works primarily on metal panels, including aircraft-grade aluminum, copper, brass, and occasionally precious metals like silver and gold. The base material significantly impacts value, with precious metal substrates commanding premium prices.

### 2. Size and Complexity

Size matters significantly in DeRubeis art valuation. His works range from smaller pieces (approximately 20×20 inches) to large installations and multi-panel works. Larger and more complex pieces, especially those featuring multiple panels, typically command higher prices in the market.

### 3. Techniques and Effects

The specific techniques employed and resulting visual effects impact value. Works featuring particularly intricate grinding patterns, complex chemical reactions, or exceptional color depth may be more valuable. Pieces that dramatically transform under different lighting conditions—a hallmark of DeRubeis' style—are especially prized by collectors.

### 4. Uniqueness

Each DeRubeis artwork is inherently unique due to the unpredictable nature of chemical reactions on metal and the artist's hand-grinding techniques. Particularly distinctive or striking pieces often achieve higher values at auction and in private sales.

### 5. Provenance and Authentication

Artwork with clear documentation of ownership history and proper authentication typically commands higher prices. DeRubeis pieces from reputable galleries or with certificates of authenticity have established provenance that enhances their value.

### 6. Recognition and Exhibition History

Works that have been featured in prominent exhibitions, received critical acclaim, or been highlighted in publications tend to have increased value. The 2005 MUSE Award for "New Movement" significantly boosted DeRubeis' market position and the value of his artwork.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Authentication and Identification" level="2" >}}
  Proper authentication is crucial when assessing the value of Chris DeRubeis artwork. Learn how to identify genuine pieces and avoid potential forgeries.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Authenticating Chris DeRubeis artwork requires attention to specific details that are characteristic of his work. Here are the key elements to consider:

### Signature Techniques

Genuine DeRubeis artworks exhibit distinctive features from his unique process:

1. **Metal Grinding Patterns**: Authentic works show DeRubeis' characteristic grinding marks, which create the foundation for his pieces. These patterns are typically fluid and organic, rather than mechanical or uniform.

2. **Chemical Reactions**: The interaction between chemicals and metal creates unique color patterns that cannot be exactly replicated. These reactions produce organic, flowing forms with depth and luminosity.

3. **Surface Texture**: DeRubeis' works feature a complex topography that interacts with light. This texture is integral to the artwork, not merely superficial.

### Documentation and Provenance

Authentic DeRubeis artwork should be accompanied by:

1. **Certificate of Authenticity**: Usually issued by the gallery representing the artist, such as Park West Gallery or his Key West gallery.

2. **Gallery Documentation**: Sales receipts, exhibition catalogs, or other documentation from authorized galleries.

3. **Photographic Record**: Many authorized galleries maintain photographic records of DeRubeis works they've sold.

### Red Flags for Potential Forgeries

Be cautious of:

1. **Inconsistent Techniques**: Forgers may attempt to imitate DeRubeis' style but typically lack the technical expertise to recreate his complex processes accurately.

2. **Suspicious Pricing**: If a "DeRubeis" is offered at a price significantly below market value without a clear reason, this may indicate a forgery.

3. **Vague Provenance**: Sellers unable or unwilling to provide clear documentation of a work's history may be selling inauthentic pieces.

4. **Poor Quality Materials**: DeRubeis uses high-quality metal substrates and finishing materials. Lower-quality materials may indicate a forgery.

For significant purchases, consider consulting an art appraiser with expertise in contemporary art or, ideally, familiarity with DeRubeis' work specifically. The investment in professional authentication can save considerable money and disappointment.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Chris DeRubeis Art as an Investment" level="2" >}}
  Evaluating the investment potential of DeRubeis artwork requires considering both market trends and the artist's position in contemporary art.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![A high-end private art collection room with a large framed Chris DeRubeis artwork prominently displayed on a feature wall](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/chris-derubeis-art-value/chris-derubeis-art-value-image-5_bI2MtMBx_.png)

Considering Chris DeRubeis artwork as an investment requires evaluating several factors that affect long-term value potential:

### Market Position and Recognition

DeRubeis has achieved significant recognition, including winning the MUSE Award for "New Movement" in 2005. This institutional recognition helps establish his place in contemporary art history and supports the long-term value of his work.

His representation by established galleries, including Park West Gallery and his own Key West gallery, provides market stability and consistent promotion of his artistic brand. This gallery support helps maintain collector interest and market presence.

### Supply and Uniqueness

The labor-intensive nature of DeRubeis' technique naturally limits his output, creating scarcity value. Each piece is inherently unique due to the unpredictable chemical reactions on metal and hand-grinding techniques, further enhancing collectibility.

### Collector Base and Market Demand

DeRubeis has developed a dedicated collector base, with some collectors focusing specifically on his work. This dedicated following helps create a stable secondary market.

The distinctive visual appeal and interactive nature of his artworks—changing appearance with lighting and viewing angle—creates lasting viewer engagement, supporting continued collector interest.

### Practical Investment Considerations

When considering DeRubeis art as an investment:

1. **Focus on Signature Works**: Pieces that exemplify DeRubeis' most distinctive techniques and styles typically hold value better over time.

2. **Condition is Crucial**: The metallic surfaces can be vulnerable to damage if not properly cared for. Investment pieces should be in excellent condition with no significant damage or restoration.

3. **Complete Documentation**: Maintain all certificates of authenticity, purchase receipts, and provenance documentation. These materials significantly impact resale value.

4. **Insurance and Display**: Insure valuable pieces appropriately and display them away from direct sunlight and humidity, which can damage the chemical finishes and protective coatings.

5. **Long-Term Perspective**: Art investments typically require a 5-10 year holding period or longer to realize significant appreciation.

While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, auction data indicates stability in DeRubeis' market with potential for modest appreciation, particularly for significant or unusual pieces. For serious investors, diversifying across multiple DeRubeis works or combining with other artists may be prudent.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Caring for DeRubeis Artwork" level="2" >}}
  Proper care and maintenance are essential for preserving both the aesthetic quality and investment value of DeRubeis metal artworks.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Chris DeRubeis' metal artworks require specific care to maintain their distinctive appearance and value:

### Cleaning and Maintenance

1. **Gentle Cleaning**: Use only a clean, soft microfiber cloth for regular dusting. For more thorough cleaning, a slightly damp microfiber cloth may be used, followed immediately by drying with a clean, dry cloth.

2. **Avoid Harsh Chemicals**: Never use metal polishes, abrasive cleaners, or alcohol-based products on DeRubeis artwork. These can damage the protective coatings and chemical finishes.

### Long-Term Preservation

1. **Protective Coatings**: DeRubeis applies special protective coatings to his artwork. If these appear to be degrading, consult a professional conservator rather than attempting repairs.

2. **Documentation**: Maintain all certificates of authenticity, purchase receipts, and care instructions in a safe location. These materials not only establish provenance but may contain specific care recommendations.

3. **Insurance**: Due to the unique nature and value of DeRubeis artwork, ensure pieces are properly insured against damage or theft. Consider specialized art insurance policies for significant collections.

4. **Professional Assessment**: Every few years, consider having valuable pieces professionally assessed for condition issues that might require attention.

Proper care not only preserves the aesthetic appeal of DeRubeis' artwork but also helps maintain its investment value. The unique interaction between light and the metal surface—a hallmark of DeRubeis' work—depends on preserving the integrity of both the textured metal and its protective finishes.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are limited editions of Chris DeRubeis artwork available?" >}}
    While DeRubeis primarily creates unique original works, he has occasionally released limited edition pieces through authorized galleries. These editions are typically smaller versions of his signature styles or specially created designs produced in strictly controlled numbers. Limited editions are generally more affordable than original works while still offering authentic DeRubeis artistic elements. If considering a limited edition, verify the authenticity through proper documentation from an authorized gallery, confirm the edition number and total size, and ensure the piece maintains the characteristic features of DeRubeis' work including metal substrate and his distinctive techniques.
