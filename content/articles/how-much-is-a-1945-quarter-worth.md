          A 1945 quarter is worth at least $5.36 based on its silver melt value.
          Depending on the mint mark and condition, circulated specimens can be
          worth $5-10, while uncirculated examples can range from $15 to over
          $40. Rare errors and exceptional specimens in MS67 or higher grades
          can be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

        text: >-
          A 1945 quarter's value is determined by its silver content (90%
          silver), mint mark (Philadelphia, Denver, or San Francisco), condition
          (grade), and any errors or varieties. The rarest and most valuable are
          those in pristine uncirculated condition or with notable minting
          errors.

          The mint mark on a 1945 Washington quarter is located on the reverse
          (tail) side, below the wreath. Quarters from Philadelphia have no mint
          mark, Denver-minted coins have a 'D' mint mark, and San
          Francisco-minted coins have an 'S' mint mark.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Introduction to 1945 Washington Quarters" level="2" >}}
The 1945 Washington quarter represents an important piece of American numismatic history, minted during the final year of World War II. These 90% silver coins are not just collectibles but also hold intrinsic metal value that makes them worth significantly more than their 25-cent face value. Whether you've discovered one in an old collection or are considering adding one to your portfolio, understanding what determines a 1945 quarter's value is essential.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![1945 Washington Silver Quarter with mint mark detail](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1945-quarter-worth/how-much-is-a-1945-quarter-worth-image-1_phDYQ6O7PB.png)

The 1945 Washington quarter is part of the Washington quarter series that began in 1932 and continues to this day, though the composition changed after 1964. These coins were designed by John Flanagan, featuring President George Washington on the obverse and an eagle on the reverse. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore what makes these coins valuable and what you can expect your 1945 quarter to be worth in today's market.

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="1945 Quarter Key Facts" columns="3" / /  >}}

| Statistic | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Face Value | $0.25 | Original denomination |
| Silver Content | 90% | 0.1808 troy oz of pure silver |
| Current Minimum Value | $5.36 | Based on silver melt value |
| Mintage (Philadelphia) | 74,372,000 | No mint mark |
| Mintage (Denver) | 37,158,000 | D mint mark |
| Mintage (San Francisco) | 17,004,001 | S mint mark |

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1945 Washington Quarter Types" level="2" >}}
The United States minted Washington quarters at three different facilities in 1945, each with its own mint mark (or lack thereof). Understanding which mint produced your quarter is the first step in determining its value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![1945 quarter showing different mint mark locations](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1945-quarter-worth/how-much-is-a-1945-quarter-worth-image-2_6hZKETVEg.png)

### Philadelphia Mint (No Mint Mark)
The Philadelphia Mint produced the highest number of quarters in 1945, with a mintage of 74,372,000. These coins have no mint mark and are the most common of the three varieties. Despite their relatively high mintage, the Philadelphia 1945 quarter is notable as the fifth lowest mintage of Philadelphia Washington quarters from 1932 to 1964, trailing only the 1932, 1938, 1949, and 1958 issues.

### Denver Mint (D Mint Mark)
The Denver Mint produced 37,158,000 quarters in 1945, marked with a small "D" on the reverse. The mint mark appears to the right of the wreath tied with a ribbon, below "QUARTER DOLLAR." These coins are less common than their Philadelphia counterparts but are still relatively available to collectors.

### San Francisco Mint (S Mint Mark)
With a mintage of just 17,004,001, the San Francisco 1945 quarter (marked with an "S") is the scarcest of the three varieties. This lower mintage makes them more valuable, particularly in higher grades. The "S" mint mark appears in the same location as the "D" on Denver coins.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Physical Characteristics of 1945 Washington Quarters" level="2" >}}
Before assessing the value of your 1945 quarter, it's important to understand its physical characteristics, as these directly impact its worth to collectors and its intrinsic metal value.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1945 Quarter Value Guide" level="2" >}}
The value of a 1945 Washington quarter depends on several factors, including mint mark, condition, and any errors or varieties. Here's a detailed breakdown of what these coins are worth in today's market.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Basic Value by Mint Mark

All 1945 quarters, regardless of condition, are worth at least their silver melt value (approximately $5.36 as of 2024 based on current silver prices). However, collector value often exceeds this base value.

  <td>$20.00-$25.00</td>
  <td>$40.00-$60.00</td>
</tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

### Premium Specimens

For high-grade specimens, particularly those graded MS-66 or higher by professional grading services, values can increase dramatically:

- 1945 (P) MS-66: $75-$150
- 1945 (P) MS-67: $400-$1,200
- 1945-D MS-66: $100-$200
- 1945-D MS-67: $500-$1,500
- 1945-S MS-66: $150-$300
- 1945-S MS-67: $700-$2,000

According to [PCGS CoinFacts](https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1945-25c/5827), the 1945 Philadelphia quarter becomes notably scarcer in MS-65 condition and considerably tougher to find in MS-66 condition compared to other Philadelphia issues of the era.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Notable 1945 Quarter Errors and Varieties" level="2" >}}
Error coins can command significant premiums over standard issues. While the 1945 Washington quarter isn't known for major error varieties, there are still some interesting anomalies that collectors seek.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![1945 quarter showing doubled die error detail](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1945-quarter-worth/how-much-is-a-1945-quarter-worth-image-4_73_jB4xUw.png)

### Double Die Errors
Double die errors occur when the die used to strike the coin receives multiple impressions at slightly different angles. On 1945 quarters, look for doubling on date numerals, the word "LIBERTY," or on Washington's features. These errors can add $50-$300 to the coin's value, depending on the severity and location of the doubling.

### Off-Center Strikes
Off-center strikes happen when the coin blank isn't properly centered during striking. The value depends on how far off-center the strike is and whether the date and mint mark are still visible:
- 5-10% off-center: $25-$50
- 20-50% off-center: $100-$300
- 50%+ off-center (with date visible): $300-$700

### Repunched Mint Marks
Sometimes mint marks were punched multiple times, creating a doubled or shifted appearance. For 1945 quarters, repunched D or S mint marks can add $20-$100 to the coin's value.

### Die Cracks and Cuds
As dies age, they can develop cracks that appear as raised lines on coins. Large die cracks or cuds (broken pieces of die that create raised blobs on the coin) can add $15-$150 to a coin's value, depending on size and location.

### Lamination Errors
Improperly mixed metal can cause layers of the coin to peel away or flake off. Lamination errors on 1945 quarters typically add $15-$75 to the coin's value.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="The Silver Content Value of 1945 Quarters" level="2" >}}
Even in poor condition, 1945 quarters will always retain value due to their silver content, providing a solid floor for their worth regardless of numismatic considerations.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![1945 quarter silver content visualization](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1945-quarter-worth/how-much-is-a-1945-quarter-worth-image-5_qQgAa-cZc.png)

### Silver Melt Value Calculation

1945 Washington quarters are composed of 90% silver and 10% copper, with a total weight of 6.25 grams. This means each coin contains approximately 0.1808 troy ounces of pure silver.

To calculate the melt value:
- Silver content: 0.1808 troy ounces
- Current silver price: Approximately $29.50 per troy ounce (as of April 2024)
- Melt value calculation: 0.1808 oz × $29.50 = $5.33

This melt value fluctuates daily with the silver market. You can check current prices on precious metals websites like [JM Bullion](https://www.jmbullion.com/coin-info/quarters/washington-quarters/1945-washington-quarter/) or [APMEX](https://learn.apmex.com/investing-guide/which-quarters-are-silver/).

### Silver Content Comparison
All U.S. quarters minted from 1932 through 1964 contain 90% silver, making them valuable for their precious metal content. After 1964, the composition changed to a copper-nickel clad, which contains no silver.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Grading 1945 Washington Quarters" level="2" >}}
Understanding how to grade your 1945 quarter can help you determine its approximate value. Here's a simplified guide to the most common grading designations.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Circulated Grades

- **Good (G-4)**: Heavily worn with major design elements visible but lacking detail. Washington's portrait is flat with little hair detail.
- **Very Good (VG-8)**: Moderate to heavy wear with some minor details starting to show. Some hair detail is visible.
- **Fine (F-12)**: Moderate wear with major features intact. More hair detail is present.
- **Very Fine (VF-20/VF-30)**: Light to moderate wear with most minor details visible. Hair strands are clear, and the eagle's feathers show some detail.
- **Extremely Fine (EF-40/EF-45)**: Light wear only on highest points. Nearly all details are sharp, with just slight wear on Washington's hair and the eagle's breast.
- **About Uncirculated (AU-50/55/58)**: Very slight wear on highest points. Coin may retain 50-95% of original mint luster.

### Uncirculated Grades

- **Mint State (MS-60 to MS-70)**: No wear from circulation, though quality increases with the number:
  - MS-60 to MS-62: No wear but may have numerous contact marks, weak strike, or poor luster
  - MS-63 to MS-64: Fewer contact marks, better strike and luster
  - MS-65 to MS-66: Few noticeable marks with very good luster and strike
  - MS-67 to MS-70: Exceptional quality with minimal to no imperfections (MS-70 is theoretically perfect)

For the most accurate valuation, consider having valuable specimens professionally graded by services like PCGS or NGC, especially for coins that appear to be in high grades (MS-65 or better) or those with potential errors.

{{< visual-modules/timeline title="History of the Washington Quarter Series" >}}
    {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1932" title="Washington Quarter Introduction" >}}
        The Washington quarter was first minted to commemorate the 200th anniversary of George Washington's birth. The obverse design by John Flanagan was selected from numerous submissions.
    {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
    
    {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1934-1964" title="Silver Washington Quarter Era" >}}
        The coins established themselves as a staple of American currency, maintaining 90% silver composition through these decades. The 1945 quarter was produced during this classic silver era.
    {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
    
    {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1965" title="Composition Change" >}}
        Due to rising silver prices, the Washington quarter's composition changed to copper-nickel clad, eliminating the silver content that had defined quarters since the series began.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Tips for Buying and Selling 1945 Quarters" level="2" >}}
Whether you're looking to add a 1945 quarter to your collection or sell one from your existing holdings, these tips can help you navigate the market more effectively.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Buying Tips

1. **Know the Market**: Research current values using reputable price guides like [PCGS CoinFacts](https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1945-25c/5827), [NGC Coin Explorer](https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/united-states/quarters/washington-quarters-1932-1998/15827/1945-25c-ms/), or [USA Coin Book](https://www.usacoinbook.com/coins/2071/quarters/washington/1945-P/).

2. **Verify Authenticity**: Learn to distinguish genuine 1945 quarters from counterfeits by checking:
   - Proper weight (6.25 grams)
   - Correct diameter (24.3 mm)
   - Authentic design details
   - Legitimate mint marks

3. **Condition Is Everything**: For collector-grade coins, condition dramatically affects value. When possible, purchase slabbed coins that have been certified by PCGS, NGC, or ANACS.

4. **Check for Cleaning**: Avoid cleaned coins, which are worth less than those with original surfaces. Look for unnatural shininess or hairline scratches that indicate cleaning.

5. **Buy from Reputable Dealers**: Purchase from established coin dealers, auction houses, or reputable online platforms that offer return policies and authenticity guarantees.

### Selling Tips

1. **Get Professional Appraisals**: For potentially valuable specimens (high grades or error coins), consider professional grading before selling.

2. **Understand Your Options**: Different venues offer different advantages:
   - Coin dealers: Quick cash but typically pay wholesale prices
   - Auction houses: Potentially higher prices but fees and longer timeframes
   - Online marketplaces: Direct to collectors but requires shipping and listing effort
   - Coin shows: In-person cash transactions with multiple competing buyers

3. **Timing Matters**: Silver content means values fluctuate with precious metal prices. Consider selling when silver prices are high.

4. **Provide Documentation**: If your coin has been authenticated or has an interesting provenance, include this information to potentially increase its value.

5. **Don't Clean Your Coins**: Never clean a coin before selling—it can significantly reduce its value to collectors who prize original surfaces.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How 1945 Quarters Compare to Other Washington Quarters" level="2" >}}
To understand the relative value and significance of 1945 quarters, it's helpful to compare them to other years in the Washington quarter series.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Key Dates Comparison

While 1945 quarters are not considered key dates in the Washington quarter series, they do have some distinguishing characteristics:

- **Mintage**: The 1945 Philadelphia mintage of 74,372,000 is the fifth lowest among Philadelphia-minted Washington quarters from 1932-1964.
- **Scarcity in High Grades**: Particularly for the Philadelphia issue, finding examples in MS-66 or better condition is considerably more difficult than for many other years.

### True Key Dates in the Series

In comparison, the true key dates in the Washington quarter series command much higher premiums:

- **1932-D**: With a mintage of only 436,800, a 1932-D in VF-20 condition is worth around $150-$200, while an MS-65 can command $5,000-$7,000.
- **1932-S**: Mintage of 408,000 makes it worth about $125-$175 in VF-20 and $4,000-$6,000 in MS-65.
- **1936-D**: Although higher mintage, it's scarcer in high grades, with MS-65 examples bringing $300-$500.

### Semi-Key Dates

Compared to semi-key dates, 1945 quarters are generally more affordable:

- **1934-D**: Worth about $30-$40 in VF-20 and $250-$400 in MS-65.
- **1937-S**: Commands around $15-$20 in VF-20 and $200-$300 in MS-65.
- **1940-D**: Sells for approximately $12-$15 in VF-20 and $150-$250 in MS-65.

The 1945 quarters, particularly the S-mint version, can be considered minor semi-keys, making them important but affordable additions to a Washington quarter collection.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About 1945 Quarters" id="faq-section" >}}
    {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are 1945 quarters rare?" open="true" >}}
        1945 quarters are not considered rare in circulated conditions, but they do become scarce in high uncirculated grades. The Philadelphia mint issue (no mint mark) is the fifth lowest mintage of Philadelphia-minted Washington quarters from 1932 to 1964, making it slightly tougher to find in gem (MS-65) condition and significantly scarcer in superb gem (MS-66+) condition compared to other Philadelphia issues of the era.
        
        The 1945-S, with a mintage of just over 17 million, is the scarcest of the three mint varieties from that year and can command higher prices in uncirculated conditions.

    {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a 1945 D quarter worth today?" >}}
        A 1945-D quarter (Denver mint) in average circulated condition is worth approximately $5.50 to $8 due to its silver content. In uncirculated conditions, the value increases significantly:
        
        - MS-60 grade: $19-$22
        - MS-65 grade: $35-$45
        - MS-66 grade: $100-$200
        - MS-67 grade: $500-$1,500
        
        These values can fluctuate based on the coin's specific condition, the current silver market, and collector demand.

    {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where is the mint mark on a 1945 quarter?" >}}
        The mint mark on a 1945 quarter is located on the reverse (back) side of the coin, near the bottom. You'll find it to the right of the ribbon that ties the wreath, directly below the words "QUARTER DOLLAR." 
        
        - Philadelphia mint coins have no mint mark
        - Denver mint coins display a "D"
        - San Francisco mint coins show an "S"
        
        The mint mark is relatively small, so you may need a magnifying glass to see it clearly, especially on well-circulated coins.

    {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the silver content of a 1945 quarter?" >}}
        A 1945 Washington quarter contains 90% silver and 10% copper. With a total weight of 6.25 grams, each coin contains approximately 0.1808 troy ounces of pure silver. At current silver prices (approximately $29.50 per ounce as of April 2024), this gives each coin a melt value of about $5.33, regardless of its condition or collector value.
        
        This silver content applies to all Washington quarters minted from 1932 through 1964. After 1964, the U.S. Mint changed the composition to copper-nickel clad with no silver content.

    {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my 1945 quarter is valuable?" >}}
        To determine if your 1945 quarter might be valuable beyond its basic silver content, look for these indicators:
        
        1. **Condition**: Coins with little to no wear, especially those with full mint luster, are worth more.
        2. **Mint Mark**: Check for a D or S mint mark, as San Francisco (S) mint quarters from 1945 are worth more in higher grades.
        3. **Errors**: Look for doubled features, off-center strikes, or repunched mint marks.
        4. **Toning**: Natural rainbow toning can add premium value.
        5. **Strike Quality**: Well-struck coins with sharp details are more desirable.
        
        For potentially valuable specimens, consider having the coin professionally graded by PCGS or NGC, as certified coins typically command higher prices and are easier to sell.

    {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What are common 1945 quarter errors to look for?" >}}
        While not known for major error varieties, 1945 quarters do exhibit some collectible errors:
        
        1. **Doubled Die Errors**: Look for doubling on the date, LIBERTY, or Washington's features.
        2. **Off-Center Strikes**: When the coin wasn't properly centered during striking.
        3. **Repunched Mint Marks**: D or S mint marks punched multiple times or in different positions.
        4. **Die Cracks and Cuds**: Raised lines or blobs caused by damaged dies.
        5. **Lamination Errors**: Flaking or peeling metal layers due to improperly mixed alloy.
        
        Errors can significantly increase a coin's value, with major errors potentially adding hundreds of dollars to the coin's worth.

    {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a 1945 quarter worth with no mint mark?" >}}
        A 1945 quarter with no mint mark (from the Philadelphia mint) in average circulated condition is worth about $5.50 to $8, primarily for its silver content. In uncirculated conditions, values increase:
        
        - MS-60 grade: $15-$20
        - MS-65 grade: $25-$35
        - MS-66 grade: $75-$150
        - MS-67 grade: $400-$1,200
        
        The 1945 Philadelphia quarter is notable for being the fifth lowest mintage of Philadelphia Washington quarters from 1932-1964, making it somewhat scarcer in very high grades (MS-66 and above) compared to other years.
    {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
    
    {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Should I clean my 1945 quarter to improve its value?" >}}
        Absolutely not! Cleaning a 1945 quarter (or any collectible coin) will almost always decrease its value, often significantly. Collectors and numismatists prize original surfaces, and cleaning removes the natural patina that develops over time.
        
        Signs of cleaning include unnatural shininess, hairline scratches, or an unnaturally bright appearance. Even professional conservation services used by museums cannot restore a coin's original surfaces once they've been damaged by cleaning.
        
        If you believe your coin is valuable, it's best to have it professionally graded in its current state rather than attempting to improve its appearance through cleaning.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Conclusion: Is Your 1945 Quarter a Hidden Treasure?" level="2" >}}
While most 1945 Washington quarters will not make you rich overnight, they represent an important piece of American numismatic history and contain significant intrinsic value through their silver content.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

At minimum, every 1945 quarter is worth approximately $5.36 in silver content alone. However, well-preserved specimens, particularly those from the San Francisco mint or those with interesting errors, can be worth substantially more to collectors.

The key to maximizing the value of your 1945 quarter is proper identification and preservation. By understanding the mint marks, recognizing potential errors, and accurately assessing condition, you can determine whether your coin is worth just its silver content or might command a premium from collectors.

Remember that the numismatic market fluctuates based on collector interest, the silver market, and the discovery of new varieties. For the most accurate and current valuation, consider consulting with a reputable coin dealer or numismatist, especially for coins that appear to be in exceptional condition or display unusual characteristics.

Whether you're a seasoned numismatist or someone who just discovered a 1945 quarter in an old collection, these coins represent both America's past and a tangible investment in precious metals—making them worth far more than their face value in any condition.
