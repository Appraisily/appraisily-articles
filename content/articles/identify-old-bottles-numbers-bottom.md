Discovering an old bottle with mysterious numbers on the bottom can feel like finding a secret code. These embossed digits and symbols are more than just manufacturing quirks—they're valuable clues that can help you identify a bottle's age, origin, and potential value. Whether you're a seasoned collector or just curious about an old bottle you've found, understanding how to "read" these bottom marks is essential for proper identification.

![Collection of antique bottles displayed with their bases showing numerical markings](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/identify-old-bottles-numbers-bottom/identify-old-bottles-numbers-bottom-image-1_00PfW-22K.png)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Understanding Numbers on Bottle Bottoms" level="2" >}}
The numbers and markings on the bottom of glass bottles serve various purposes in the manufacturing process. Knowing what these codes mean can help you accurately date and identify your bottle.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

When examining the bottom of an old bottle, you'll often find a variety of markings. These can include numbers, letters, symbols, or combinations of all three. While some markings clearly identify the manufacturer, others indicate more technical aspects of the bottle's production.

In most cases, one- or two-digit numbers found on bottle bottoms are **mold numbers**. These numbers served to identify the specific bottle mold or section in an automatic bottle machine. If multiple identical molds were used in production, each one received its own identifying number.

Other numerical markings might indicate:
- Bottle style or catalog number
- Year of manufacture
- Plant location codes
- Glass formula identification

Understanding these codes requires some knowledge of glass manufacturing history and techniques. Let's explore the most common types of bottle bottom markings and what they reveal.

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Bottle Base Marking Facts" columns="3" / /  >}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Types of Bottle Bottom Numbers" level="2" >}}
Not all numbers on bottle bottoms serve the same purpose. Learning to distinguish between different types of numerical markings is key to proper bottle identification.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Mold Numbers

The most common numbers found on bottle bottoms are mold numbers, typically appearing as single or double digits. These numbers were used by glass manufacturers to identify specific molds or sections of automatic bottle machines.

Glass factories often operated multiple molds simultaneously to increase production efficiency. By numbering each mold, manufacturers could:

1. Track production output from each mold
2. Identify quality control issues specific to a particular mold
3. Document when molds needed maintenance or replacement

Mold numbers don't typically provide information about the bottle's age or origin—they were purely for internal factory use.

### Date Codes

Some bottles feature numbers that indicate manufacturing dates. Date codes can appear in several formats:

- **Single or double-digit year:** A single number like "7" might indicate manufacture in 1937, 1947, etc. Context clues like bottle style help narrow down the decade.
- **Two-digit year:** Numbers like "42" commonly represent 1942.
- **Date-month combination:** Numbers like "15-6" might indicate June 1915.

Date codes became more standardized in the 20th century, particularly after the 1940s, when many glass companies adopted clearer dating systems.

### Plant Codes

Many glass manufacturers operated multiple factories. Numbers on bottle bottoms sometimes indicated which plant produced the bottle. These codes were often used alongside manufacturer's marks.

For instance, the Owens-Illinois Glass Company used a numerical plant code system, where the number to the left of their trademark indicated the manufacturing plant, and the number to the right typically indicated the year of manufacture.

![Antique bottle with manufacturer's mark and plant code visible on base](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/identify-old-bottles-numbers-bottom/identify-old-bottles-numbers-bottom-image-3_lysnGVRG6.png)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Manufacturer's Marks and Codes" level="2" >}}
Beyond simple numbers, many bottles feature distinctive makers' marks that can help identify their origin and approximate age.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Manufacturer's marks are perhaps the most useful markings for bottle identification. These are embossed symbols, letters, or logos that identify which glass company produced the bottle. When used in combination with numerical codes, they provide valuable dating information.

Some common manufacturer's marks include:

- **Owens-Illinois:** An "I" inside an "O" or diamond, used from 1929 onwards
- **Hazel-Atlas:** An "H" over an "A", used from 1923 to 1964
- **Ball:** The word "BALL" in script or block letters
- **Brockway Glass:** A "B" inside a circle or the letters "BGCO"
- **Anchor Hocking:** An anchor symbol or "AH" mark

The Society for Historical Archaeology (SHA) maintains an extensive [database of bottle makers' marks](https://sha.org/bottle/makersmarks.htm) that can help you identify these symbols.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Dot Codes and Stippling Patterns" level="2" >}}
The arrangement of dots on a bottle bottom may look random, but they often form a specific code that provides manufacturing information.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Modern bottles often feature dot patterns or stippling on their bases. While these dots serve practical manufacturing purposes (helping release the bottle from the mold), they can also contain encoded information.

Dot patterns might indicate:

1. The specific mold cavity that made the bottle
2. The date of manufacture (in a dot-code format)
3. Quality control tracking information

For example, a pattern showing "four dots, space, one dot, space, four dots" could represent a specific mold position in the manufacturing line or a particular production date.

These dot codes became more common after the 1940s with the widespread adoption of automated bottle-making machines. The specific meaning of dot patterns often varied between glass manufacturers, making them challenging to decode without company-specific references.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Using Mold Seams and Production Techniques for Dating" level="2" >}}
While not directly related to base numbers, understanding how bottle production techniques evolved can provide important context for interpreting numerical codes.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Bottle production technology changed significantly over time, and these changes left visible marks on the bottles. When combined with base numbers, these manufacturing clues can help narrow down a bottle's age:

1. **Pontil Marks (pre-1860s):** A rough circular scar on the bottle base indicates it was handmade using a pontil rod. These bottles rarely have mold numbers.

2. **Mold Seams (1860s-1920):** Visible seam lines on the bottle's body indicate it was made in a mold. The height of these seams helps date the bottle:
   - Seams ending at the neck: 1860s-1880s
   - Seams extending onto the neck: 1880s-1910s
   - Seams all the way to the lip: After 1910

3. **Suction Scars (1905-1920s):** Distinctive circular or oval marks on the bottle bottom from Owens Automatic Bottle Machines.

4. **Valve Marks (1930s-present):** Small, off-center circular marks on the bottom from modern automated production.

The Society for Historical Archaeology offers excellent resources for [dating bottles based on manufacturing techniques](https://sha.org/bottle/dating.htm).

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Step-by-Step Guide to Identifying Bottles by Base Numbers" level="2" >}}
Follow this systematic approach to decode the numbers and markings on your bottle's bottom.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Step 1: Examine the Base Thoroughly

Start by cleaning the bottle base gently to ensure all markings are visible. Use good lighting and a magnifying glass if needed. Look for:

- Numbers (single digits, double digits, or number sequences)
- Letters or letter combinations
- Symbols, logos, or trademarks
- Dot patterns or stippling
- Physical characteristics (pontil marks, valve marks, etc.)

Take clear photos or make detailed sketches of all markings.

### Step 2: Identify Manufacturer's Marks

Before focusing on numbers, try to identify any manufacturer's marks or logos. These provide critical context for interpreting the numbers. Use reference resources like:

- The [Society for Historical Archaeology's makers marks database](https://sha.org/bottle/makersmarks.htm)
- Bottle collector guides and reference books
- Online bottle collector forums

### Step 3: Analyze the Numbers

Once you've identified the manufacturer (if possible), examine the numbers:

- **Single digits (1-9)** are typically mold numbers
- **Two-digit numbers** might be mold numbers, plant codes, or year codes
- **Three or more digits** often indicate catalog numbers or date codes

For Owens-Illinois bottles, for example, the number to the left of the logo is the plant number, and the number to the right is typically the year of manufacture.

### Step 4: Consider Bottle Style and Use

The bottle's shape, color, and intended purpose provide important context:

- Medicine bottles often have different coding systems than beverage bottles
- Food bottles might use different numbering than cosmetic bottles
- Milk bottles frequently used date codes related to dairy regulations

### Step 5: Cross-Reference with Multiple Sources

Bottle identification is sometimes more art than science. Cross-reference your findings with multiple sources and consider joining bottle collecting forums where experts can help interpret unusual markings.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Common Bottle Manufacturer Marks and Their History" level="2" >}}
Recognizing these common bottle manufacturer marks will help you narrow down when and where your bottle was made.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Owens-Illinois Glass Company (1929-present)
- **Mark:** "I" inside an "O" or diamond
- **Numbering System:** Plant number (left) and year (right)
- Plant numbers range from 1-32, representing different factory locations
- Year numbers are single or double digits (e.g., "4" for 1934 or 1944, context determines decade)

### Hazel-Atlas Glass Company (1902-1964)
- **Mark:** "H" over an "A"
- **Numbering System:** Often includes a single-digit mold number 
- After 1923, may include a date code (single digit for year)

### Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company (1880s-present)
- **Mark:** "BALL" in script or block letters
- **Numbering System:** Simple mold numbers or sometimes year codes
- Style of the Ball logo itself helps date the bottle

### Anchor Hocking Glass Corporation (1937-present)
- **Mark:** Anchor symbol, sometimes with "H" or numbers
- **Numbering System:** Plant and date codes vary by era

### Brockway Glass Company (1907-1988)
- **Mark:** "B" in a circle or "BGCO"
- **Numbering System:** Mold numbers and later date codes after the 1950s

These major manufacturers had fairly consistent marking systems, but many smaller glass companies used less standardized approaches. Regional bottle makers might use their own unique marking systems or simply their initials.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Bottle Bottom Numbers" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What do one- or two-digit numbers on the bottom of glass bottles mean?" >}}
    In most cases, one- or two-digit numbers on bottle bottoms are mold numbers. These numbers identified the specific bottle mold or section in an automatic bottle machine. If multiple identical molds were used in production, each received its own number. These numbers were primarily for quality control and manufacturing purposes, allowing factories to track which molds produced which bottles.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell how old a bottle is from the bottom markings?" >}}
    Dating a bottle based on bottom markings requires analyzing several factors:
    
    1. Identify any manufacturer's marks and research when that company was in operation
    2. Look for date codes (some manufacturers included year numbers)
    3. Examine production techniques (pontil marks, mold seams, etc.)
    4. Consider the bottle's physical characteristics (color, shape, seams)
    
    The most reliable dating comes from combining information from base markings with physical characteristics. For example, if a bottle has an Owens-Illinois mark with numbers "7" and "41", and the seams extend all the way to the lip, you can confidently date it to 1941, manufactured at plant #7.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What are the dots or stippling patterns on modern bottle bottoms?" >}}
    Dot patterns or stippling on bottle bottoms serve multiple purposes:
    
    1. **Manufacturing function**: The raised dots help release the bottle from the mold and allow even distribution of glass during formation
    2. **Mold identification**: Specific patterns can identify which mold cavity produced the bottle
    3. **Date/batch coding**: Some manufacturers use dot patterns as a form of code to indicate production date or batch
    4. **Quality control**: Dot patterns can help trace production issues back to specific manufacturing equipment
    
    The specific meaning of dot patterns varies between manufacturers, making them challenging to decode without company-specific references.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are there apps that can help identify old bottles by their bottom markings?" >}}
    While there isn't yet a comprehensive "Shazam for bottles" that can instantly identify any bottle from its base markings, several apps and online resources can help:
    
    1. **General antique identification apps**: Applications like Google Lens can sometimes identify common bottle types or direct you to similar images online
    2. **Collector community platforms**: Apps and websites where you can upload images for identification by knowledgeable collectors
    3. **Reference databases**: Online databases of bottle makers' marks and numerical codes
    
    The most reliable bottle identification still comes from combining technology with research and expert knowledge. Collector forums and communities remain invaluable resources for identifying unusual or rare bottles.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I read Owens-Illinois bottle codes?" >}}
    Owens-Illinois bottle codes follow a relatively standardized format, especially after 1940:
    
    ```
    [Plant Number] [Maker's Mark] [Year Number] [Other codes]
    ```
    
    For example, if you see "7 ⬦ 46", this indicates:
    - "7" = Plant #7 (Alton, Illinois)
    - "⬦" = Owens-Illinois maker's mark (diamond with "I" inside)
    - "46" = Year 1946
    
    Some bottles might include additional numbers that indicate mold cavities or other production information. Between 1929-1954, Owens-Illinois used single-digit year codes, requiring context to determine the decade (e.g., "9" could be 1939 or 1949). After 1954, they typically used two-digit year codes.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Can the numbers on bottle bottoms determine their value?" >}}
    While numbers alone rarely determine a bottle's value, they can contribute significantly by helping:
    
    1. **Confirm authenticity**: Correct manufacturer marks and date codes can verify a bottle is genuinely from the period claimed
    2. **Establish rarity**: Some manufacturing plants or production years were more limited than others
    3. **Identify special productions**: Certain mold numbers or codes might indicate limited editions or special production runs
    
    Bottle value is primarily determined by rarity, condition, aesthetic appeal, historical significance, and collector demand. The numbers and marks help establish provenance, which affects these value factors. For example, a rare color bottle with confirmed early dating from bottom marks would be worth more than a similar bottle without verifiable age.
