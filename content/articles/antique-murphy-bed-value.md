Today, antique Murphy beds from the early 1900s have become sought-after collectibles, valued for their craftsmanship, historical significance, and practical functionality. But determining the worth of these vintage wall beds can be challenging for collectors and sellers alike.

Whether you've inherited one of these space-saving marvels or are considering adding one to your collection, this article will help you navigate the specialized market for these unique furniture pieces.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="The History of Murphy Beds" level="2" >}}
Understanding the origins and evolution of Murphy beds provides valuable context for assessing their value in today's antiques market.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The Murphy bed was invented by William Lawrence Murphy around 1900 in San Francisco. Legend has it that Murphy was living in a one-room apartment and wanted to entertain guests, particularly a female opera singer he was courting. Due to the social norms of the time, it was improper to have a bed in a room where one entertained guests, so he created a fold-up bed that could be hidden in a closet.

Murphy patented his "Disappearing Bed" in 1908 and founded the Murphy Wall Bed Company. The beds gained enormous popularity in the early 20th century, particularly in growing urban areas where space was at a premium. The original Murphy beds were typically made of high-quality oak, mahogany, or walnut with ornate carvings that matched other furniture styles of the era.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors Affecting Antique Murphy Bed Values" level="2" >}}
Several key elements determine how much an antique Murphy bed is worth in today's market. Understanding these factors can help you assess the value of your piece.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Age and Authenticity

The older the Murphy bed, generally the more valuable it is. Pieces from the 1900-1920 period, especially those with verifiable provenance or original documentation, command premium prices. Early models with the original Murphy Wall Bed Company markings or patent stamps can be particularly valuable.

### Materials and Construction

Most antique Murphy beds were constructed from solid hardwoods:

- Oak: The most common material, particularly quarter-sawn oak in the Craftsman or Mission style
- Mahogany: Used in more upscale models
- Walnut: Less common but highly valued
- Combination of woods with decorative veneers

The quality of wood, joinery methods, and hardware all factor into the valuation. Hand-crafted details like dovetail joints and mortise-and-tenon construction indicate higher quality and thus higher value.

### Design and Decorative Elements

The style and ornamentation of the bed cabinet significantly impact value:

- Victorian-style beds with elaborate carvings and embellishments
- Arts and Crafts/Mission style with straight lines and visible joinery
- Art Deco models with geometric patterns and streamlined designs

Murphy beds designed to look like other furniture pieces when folded up (such as bookcases, desks, or dressers) tend to be more valuable due to their dual functionality and clever design.

### Condition

As with all antiques, condition is paramount:

- Original finish in good condition
- Functional mechanical components
- Intact hardware (handles, hinges, springs)
- Minimal repairs or replacements
- Structural integrity

A bed with its original spring mechanism in working order will be worth significantly more than one that requires restoration or has been modified.

![Antique Murphy bed in opened position showing the bed frame and springs](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/antique-murphy-bed-value/antique-murphy-bed-value-image-3_1g6P2yQNj.png)

### Size and Practicality

Full-size or queen-size Murphy beds tend to be more valuable than twin sizes because they have broader appeal to modern buyers. Additionally, beds with dimensions that can accommodate modern mattresses without modification will command higher prices.

### Completeness

An antique Murphy bed with all its original components intact is worth considerably more than one missing parts:

- Original mattress platform and springs
- All decorative elements and hardware
- Accompanying headboard or footboard (if the original design included them)
- Integrated features like lighting or storage compartments

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Key Value Indicators" columns="3" / / />}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Current Market Values" level="2" >}}
Understanding the price ranges for antique Murphy beds can help both sellers set realistic expectations and buyers make informed purchasing decisions.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The value of antique Murphy beds can vary widely based on the factors listed above. Here's a breakdown of current market values as of 2024:

It's worth noting that geographic location can significantly impact pricing. Urban areas where space is limited, such as New York City or San Francisco, often see higher demand and thus higher prices for Murphy beds, both antique and modern.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How to Identify an Authentic Antique Murphy Bed" level="2" >}}
Distinguishing a genuine antique Murphy bed from a reproduction or newer model requires attention to several key identification markers.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Patent Markings and Labels

Authentic Murphy beds from the early 1900s often include:

- Patent stamps or metal plates with patent dates (look for Pat. 1908, 1912, or 1916)
- "Murphy Door Bed Company" or "Murphy Wall Bed Company" labels
- Serial numbers stamped into the metal hardware

### Construction Methods

Examine the construction techniques used:

- Hand-cut dovetail joints in drawers and cabinet components
- Mortise-and-tenon joinery
- Cut nails or square head screws (rather than Phillips head)
- Quarter-sawn oak or other period-appropriate hardwoods
- Hand-carved decorative elements

### Hardware Analysis

The hardware provides significant clues to authenticity:

- Cast iron or brass hinges and mechanisms
- Strong coil springs (often manufactured by companies like Seng)
- Hand-forged or early machine-made components
- Patina and wear consistent with age

### Style and Design Elements

Different periods had characteristic design elements:

- Early models (1900-1915): Often featured heavy Victorian or Edwardian styling
- 1915-1925: Arts and Crafts/Mission influence with straight lines and visible joinery
- 1925-1940: Art Deco influences with geometric patterns and streamlined forms

### Signs of Age and Use

Look for natural aging that's difficult to fake:

- Even patina across wooden surfaces
- Wear patterns consistent with functional use
- Original finish that shows appropriate aging
- Minor repairs that match the period

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Restoration Considerations" level="2" >}}
Deciding whether to restore an antique Murphy bed requires careful consideration of how it will affect both value and functionality.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Value Impact of Restoration

The effect of restoration on value depends largely on the approach taken:

- **Conservative Restoration**: Preserving as much original material as possible while ensuring functionality typically maintains or increases value.
- **Overzealous Modernization**: Replacing original components with modern equivalents, stripping original finishes, or modifying the design can significantly decrease value to collectors.
- **Structural Repairs**: Necessary repairs to ensure safety and function generally don't negatively impact value if done sympathetically.

### Restoration Best Practices

If you decide to restore an antique Murphy bed:

1. **Document Everything**: Take detailed photographs before beginning any work.
2. **Research**: Study the specific model and manufacturer to understand original specifications.
3. **Consult Experts**: Work with restoration specialists who understand antique furniture mechanisms.
4. **Preserve Original Elements**: Keep as many original components as possible.
5. **Use Period-Appropriate Materials**: If replacements are necessary, use similar materials and techniques.
6. **Address Safety Issues**: Ensure the restored bed is safe for use while maintaining period authenticity.

### Common Restoration Challenges

Restorers of antique Murphy beds frequently encounter these issues:

- **Spring Mechanism Problems**: Original springs may be worn or broken and require careful replacement.
- **Wood Repairs**: Fixing splits, cracks, or weak joints without compromising the appearance.
- **Hardware Replacements**: Finding appropriate period hardware if originals are missing.
- **Finish Restoration**: Reviving the original finish without completely stripping and refinishing.
- **Mattress Support Adaptation**: Modifying to accommodate modern mattresses while preserving the original look.

{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Market Trends

The market for antique Murphy beds has shown interesting patterns:

- **Increasing Scarcity**: As these beds age, fewer examples remain in good condition, potentially driving up prices.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Antique Murphy Beds" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is an antique Murphy bed worth?" >}}
Antique Murphy beds typically range in value from $1,200 to $3,000 depending on condition, age, and design quality. Entry-level pieces in need of restoration might sell for $400-$1,000, while exceptional examples with unique features or historical significance can command $4,000-$7,500+.

  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my Murphy bed is antique?" >}}
Look for these key indicators to identify an authentic antique Murphy bed:

- Patent stamps or metal plates with early dates (1908-1925)
- "Murphy Door Bed Company" or "Murphy Wall Bed Company" markings
- Hand-cut joinery like dovetails and mortise-and-tenon construction
- Period-appropriate hardwoods like quarter-sawn oak or mahogany

- Design elements consistent with early 20th century styles
- Square head screws or cut nails rather than Phillips head screws
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Do antique Murphy beds increase home value?" >}}
An authentic, well-maintained antique Murphy bed can add value to a home, particularly in urban areas where space is at a premium. According to Wallbeds USA, a Murphy bed installation can add value by effectively increasing the usable square footage of a room. A well-integrated antique Murphy bed with historical character may add both practical value and architectural interest to a property. However, the value-add depends on the home's market, the bed's condition, and whether it appeals to potential buyers.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How old does a Murphy bed need to be to be considered antique?" >}}
For a Murphy bed to be considered truly antique, it generally needs to be at least 100 years old. This means Murphy beds from the 1900s through the early 1920s are now classified as antiques. Pieces from the 1920s through the 1950s are typically considered "vintage" rather than antique. The most collectible Murphy beds tend to be from the earliest production periods (1900-1920), when craftsmanship and materials were often of the highest quality.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the most valuable type of antique Murphy bed?" >}}
The most valuable antique Murphy beds typically feature these characteristics:

1. Early production dates (1900-1920)
2. Original patent stamps and manufacturer markings
3. Exceptional craftsmanship with hand-carved details
4. Rare woods or distinctive design elements
5. Dual-purpose functionality (e.g., beds that fold into desks or bookshelves)
6. Complete original hardware and mechanisms in working order
7. Documented provenance from significant buildings or owners

Eastlake style and Victorian Murphy beds with ornate carvings and original finish in excellent condition command the highest prices in today's market.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Should I restore my antique Murphy bed or sell it as is?" >}}
This decision depends on several factors:

- **Current Condition**: If the bed is in poor but complete condition, careful restoration may increase its value.
- **Completeness**: If many original parts are missing, restoration costs may exceed the resulting value increase.
- **Your Expertise**: DIY restoration by inexperienced hands can decrease value; professional restoration is recommended.
- **Intended Market**: Serious collectors often prefer pieces with original patina and minor wear over heavily restored examples.
- **Personal Use**: If you plan to use the bed yourself, functionality-focused restoration makes more sense.

Generally, conservation (stabilizing and preserving the original) rather than full restoration is the safer approach for maintaining value.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Can antique Murphy beds accommodate modern mattresses?" >}}
Many antique Murphy beds require adaptation to fit modern mattresses, which tend to be thicker than those from the early 20th century. Some considerations:

- Original Murphy beds typically accommodated mattresses 5-6 inches thick, while modern mattresses are often 10-14 inches thick
- The bed mechanism may need adjustment to support the additional weight
- Some collectors modify the frame while preserving the external cabinet and hardware
- Memory foam or hybrid mattresses designed for Murphy beds (typically 6-8 inches thick) can be a good compromise
- Professional modification by a restoration specialist can adapt the bed while maintaining its antique character
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What sizes were antique Murphy beds typically made in?" >}}
Antique Murphy beds were commonly made in these sizes:

- Three-quarter size (approximately 48" x 75")
- Full/double size (approximately 54" x 75")
- Twin size (approximately 39" x 75")

True queen and king sizes were not standard in the early Murphy bed era, as these larger mattress sizes didn't become commonplace until the mid-20th century. The dimensions of antique beds often don't precisely match modern standard sizes, which can be a consideration when planning to use an antique Murphy bed with a contemporary mattress.
