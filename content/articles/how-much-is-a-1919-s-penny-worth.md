{{< content-modules/section-header title="Introduction to the 1919-S Lincoln Wheat Penny" level="2" >}}
The 1919-S Lincoln wheat penny represents an important transitional period in American numismatics, produced during the aftermath of World War I at the San Francisco Mint. For collectors of the Lincoln cent series, the 1919-S holds special appeal as a semi-key date with growing value in higher grades.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![1919-S Lincoln wheat penny showing obverse with Lincoln profile and S mint mark](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1919-s-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1919-s-penny-worth-image-1_N_-IGXior.png)

The 1919-S penny features the classic wheat reverse design created by Victor David Brenner, with Abraham Lincoln's profile on the obverse. While not as rare as the famous 1909-S VDB or 1914-D, the 1919-S has become increasingly sought after by collectors seeking to complete their Lincoln cent collections.

With a mintage of 139,760,000 coins, the 1919-S isn't particularly scarce in circulated grades. However, well-preserved examples—especially those with original mint luster—can command substantial premiums in today's market. Understanding what makes this coin valuable requires examining its history, rarity factors, and condition characteristics.

According to the [NGC Price Guide](https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/united-states/cents/lincoln-cents-wheat-reverse-1909-1958/12519/1919-s-1c-ms/), uncirculated examples of the 1919-S in MS (Mint State) with Brown surfaces can range from $75 to $540, while those with Red-Brown coloration command approximately $125 to $1,750. The most valuable specimens are those with full Red surfaces, which can fetch between $180 to an impressive $55,000 depending on the grade.

For circulated examples, [USA Coin Book](https://www.usacoinbook.com/coins/374/small-cents/lincoln-wheat-cent/1919-S/) estimates that a 1919-S Lincoln cent in average condition is worth approximately $0.78, while uncirculated examples can range from $71 to $141 or more.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="What Makes the 1919-S Penny Special" level="2" >}}
Several factors contribute to the 1919-S penny's status as a semi-key date in the Lincoln cent series. Understanding these elements helps collectors determine why certain examples command higher prices than others.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Close-up of 1919-S penny showing mint mark and detail of Lincoln's profile](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1919-s-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1919-s-penny-worth-image-3_XfozVQzi2.png)

According to [PCGS](https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1919-s-1c-rd/2521), the 1919-S is considered a semi-key date in the Lincoln cent series for several important reasons:

{{< interactive-modules/condition-checklist title="Factors That Make the 1919-S Penny Valuable" description="Check which attributes apply to your coin" >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Mint mark: Bears the 'S' mintmark from San Francisco" /  >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Scarcity in high grades: Significantly rarer in MS65 or above" /  >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Red luster: Original mint red color is exceptionally rare" /  >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Strike quality: Often poorly struck compared to Philadelphia issues" /  >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Historical significance: Post-WWI era coinage" /  >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Preservation challenges: Original red specimens rarely survived" /  >}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

While examples in circulated grades are relatively common, the 1919-S becomes increasingly scarce in Uncirculated condition, particularly in MS65 or higher grades. The most coveted specimens are those that maintain their original mint red color, which is exceedingly difficult to find for this issue.

Strike quality is another significant factor. Many 1919-S cents were weakly struck, particularly on the reverse wheat ears. Examples with full strikes and sharp details command substantial premiums.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1919-S Penny Error Varieties Worth Searching For" level="2" >}}
Like many coins of this era, the 1919-S penny has several error varieties that can significantly increase its value. These varieties range from minor die cracks to major doubling errors.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![1919-S penny error variety showing doubling on date and lettering](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1919-s-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1919-s-penny-worth-image-4_QtHQHqqKc.png)

### Doubled Die Obverse Varieties

While not as famous as the 1955 Doubled Die Obverse, the 1919-S has subtle doubled die varieties that show doubling on the date, LIBERTY, or IN GOD WE TRUST. These varieties can increase the value of a 1919-S cent by 50-100% or more, depending on the strength of the doubling and the coin's condition.

### Repunched Mint Mark

Some 1919-S cents show evidence of a repunched mint mark, where the "S" was punched into the die more than once at slightly different positions. These varieties typically command a 20-50% premium over standard examples.

### Die Cracks and Cuds

Late-stage die cracks, particularly those forming "cuds" (raised areas of metal where a piece of the die has broken away), can add collectible interest and value to a 1919-S cent. Major die breaks can increase value by 25-100% depending on their prominence.

### Off-Center Strikes

Off-center strikes occur when the planchet is not properly centered between the dies. The value depends on how far off-center the strike is and whether the date and mint mark remain visible. A 1919-S penny that is 15-20% off-center but still shows the complete date and mint mark might be worth $100-200 even in circulated condition.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Grading Your 1919-S Lincoln Cent" level="2" >}}
The value of a 1919-S wheat penny is heavily dependent on its grade. Understanding how to roughly assess your coin's condition can help determine its approximate value before seeking professional grading.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Comparison of 1919-S pennies in different grades showing wear patterns and luster](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1919-s-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1919-s-penny-worth-image-5_naZkk4BNM.png)

### Key Areas to Examine

When grading a 1919-S Lincoln cent, pay particular attention to these areas:

1. **Lincoln's Hair Details**: In circulated coins, the hair details above Lincoln's ear will wear first. In higher grades, these details should be sharp and fully defined.

2. **Cheek and Jaw Area**: The high points of Lincoln's cheek and jaw will show wear even in relatively high-grade circulated examples.

3. **Wheat Ear Details**: The lines in the wheat ears on the reverse often show weak strikes on 1919-S cents. Look for full definition in these areas.

4. **Luster and Color**: Uncirculated coins are categorized by color:
   - Brown (BN): Coins that have lost their original mint red color
   - Red-Brown (RB): Coins with 5-70% original red color remaining
   - Red (RD): Coins retaining at least 90% of their original mint red color

### Numerical Grading Scale

According to the standard Sheldon grading scale used by [PCGS](https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1919-s-1c-rd/2521) and [NGC](https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/united-states/cents/lincoln-cents-wheat-reverse-1909-1958/12519/1919-s-1c-ms/), Lincoln cents are graded as follows:

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1919-S Penny Grading Guide" description="Key characteristics of different grades" >}}
<tr>
  <td>Good (G-4)</td>
  <td>Heavy wear, outline of Lincoln visible, rims intact</td>
  <td>Most details worn smooth</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Very Good (VG-8)</td>
  <td>Moderate to heavy wear, some hair detail visible</td>
  <td>LIBERTY partially visible</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Fine (F-12)</td>
  <td>Moderate wear, major features clearly defined</td>
  <td>LIBERTY fully visible</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Very Fine (VF-20/30)</td>
  <td>Light to moderate wear on high points</td>
  <td>Some hair detail visible</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Extremely Fine (EF/XF-40/45)</td>
  <td>Light wear on highest points, most details sharp</td>
  <td>Most hair strands distinct</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>About Uncirculated (AU-50/58)</td>
  <td>Trace of wear on high points, most luster intact</td>
  <td>Full hair detail with slight wear</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Mint State (MS-60 to MS-70)</td>
  <td>No wear, may have contact marks or weak strike</td>
  <td>Full original surface, varying degrees of luster/marks</td>
</tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

For the most accurate assessment and maximum value, consider having your 1919-S penny professionally graded by PCGS or NGC, particularly if it appears to be in uncirculated condition or shows any of the error varieties discussed earlier.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Comparing the 1919-S to Other 1919 Lincoln Cents" level="2" >}}
The 1919-S is one of three Lincoln cent varieties produced that year, alongside the Philadelphia (no mint mark) and Denver (D) issues. Understanding how the 1919-S compares to its counterparts provides important context for collectors.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The U.S. Mint produced Lincoln cents at three facilities in 1919:

1. **Philadelphia (no mint mark)**: 392,021,000 minted
2. **Denver (D mint mark)**: 57,154,000 minted
3. **San Francisco (S mint mark)**: 139,760,000 minted

The 1919-S falls in the middle in terms of mintage numbers, but due to factors like strike quality, survival rates, and collecting patterns, it is generally more valuable than the Philadelphia issue and slightly less valuable than the Denver issue in most grades.

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1919 Lincoln Cent Comparison" description="Value comparison across the three mint varieties" >}}
<tr>
  <td>1919 (Philadelphia)</td>
  <td>$0.29 in G-4</td>
  <td>$29 in MS-63 BN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1919-D (Denver)</td>
  <td>$1.20 in G-4</td>
  <td>$149 in MS-63 BN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1919-S (San Francisco)</td>
  <td>$0.59 in G-4</td>
  <td>$100 in MS-63 BN</td>
</tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

According to [Coin Value Checker](https://www.coinvaluechecker.com/how-much-is-a-1919-wheat-penny-worth/), the 1919-S commands a slight premium over the Philadelphia issue but doesn't quite reach the values of the scarcer 1919-D in most grades. However, in the highest uncirculated grades with full red color, the 1919-S can sometimes surpass the 1919-D in value due to its greater condition rarity.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How to Sell Your 1919-S Penny" level="2" >}}
If you've determined that your 1919-S penny is valuable and you'd like to sell it, several options are available depending on the coin's condition, rarity, and estimated value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Best Options for Selling Your 1919-S Penny

1. **Coin Dealers**: Local coin shops can provide immediate offers, though they typically pay wholesale prices (60-80% of retail value).

2. **Online Marketplaces**: Platforms like eBay allow you to reach a wide audience of collectors. For higher-value coins (over $100), consider using auction services with authentication protection.

3. **Coin Shows**: Selling at numismatic shows allows you to get multiple offers from dealers in one location, potentially resulting in better prices.

4. **Auction Houses**: For rare varieties or high-grade examples worth over $500, specialized numismatic auction houses like Heritage Auctions, Stack's Bowers, or Great Collections may offer the best returns.

5. **Collector Forums**: Online communities like the [Coin Community Forum](https://www.coincommunity.com/) or [Reddit's r/Coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/) can connect you directly with collectors, though proceed with caution and use secure payment methods.

### Professional Grading Considerations

For 1919-S cents that appear to be:
- In uncirculated condition
- Displaying significant red color
- Showing possible error varieties
- Exceptionally well-preserved

Consider having the coin professionally graded by PCGS or NGC before selling. The cost (typically $20-50 per coin including membership fees) can be worthwhile for coins potentially worth over $100, as graded coins typically command 20-30% higher prices than ungraded examples of similar quality.

According to market data from [Grey Sheet](https://www.greysheet.com/prices/item?gsid=1859), a certified MS65 Red 1919-S cent can sell for 5-10 times more than a similar-looking ungraded example due to the certainty the certification provides to buyers.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Preserving Your 1919-S Penny" level="2" >}}
Whether you're keeping your 1919-S penny as an investment or planning to sell it in the future, proper preservation is essential to maintain its condition and value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Storage Recommendations

1. **Coin Holders**: Store your 1919-S cent in an inert, PVC-free holder. Options include:
   - Mylar flips
   - Hard plastic capsules
   - PCGS or NGC holders (for certified coins)
   
2. **Environmental Factors**: Keep coins away from:
   - Humidity (which can cause corrosion)
   - Direct sunlight (which can affect color)
   - Temperature fluctuations
   - Chemicals and household cleaners

3. **Handling Best Practices**:
   - Always hold coins by their edges
   - Wear cotton gloves when possible
   - Never clean coins (this can dramatically reduce value)
   - Avoid touching the surface with bare fingers

### Common Preservation Mistakes to Avoid

- **Cleaning or polishing**: Even gentle cleaning can damage a coin's original surfaces and significantly reduce its numismatic value. A cleaned 1919-S cent can lose 50-80% of its collector value.

- **Improper storage materials**: Many coin holders made of soft plastic contain PVC, which can damage coins over time. Always use archival-quality, PVC-free storage materials.

- **Handling uncirculated coins directly**: The oils and acids from human skin can damage a coin's surfaces and diminish its luster, particularly affecting red copper cents.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About 1919-S Penny Values" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes a 1919-S penny rare?" >}}
    According to PCGS, the 1919-S penny is considered a semi-key date in the Lincoln cent series. While examples in circulated grades are fairly common, the coin becomes increasingly scarce in uncirculated condition, particularly in MS65 grade or higher.

    The rarity factors that make a 1919-S penny valuable include:

    1. Original red color - specimens displaying full red surfaces are extremely difficult to find
    2. Strike quality - many 1919-S cents were weakly struck, so examples with full strike details command premiums
    3. Preservation - fewer high-grade examples survived compared to Philadelphia-minted pennies
    4. Error varieties - doubled dies and repunched mint marks are especially desirable

    The most valuable 1919-S pennies combine these factors: a fully struck, error-free or significant error variety coin with original red surfaces in MS65 or higher grade.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a 1919-S one cent coin worth?" >}}
    The value of a 1919-S one cent coin varies significantly based on its condition:

    - In circulated condition (Good to Very Fine): $0.35 to $5
    - In Extremely Fine condition: $15 to $25
    - In About Uncirculated condition: $30 to $60
    - In Mint State-60 Brown: $75 to $100
    - In Mint State-63 Brown: $100 to $150
    - In Mint State-65 Brown: $250 to $300
    - In Mint State-65 Red-Brown: $500 to $750
    - In Mint State-65 Red: $1,000 to $2,500
    - In Mint State-67 Red: $10,000 to $55,000+

    According to NGC, a 1919-S cent in Mint State with a Brown designation can be worth between $75 and $540, while those with Red-Brown coloration fetch approximately $125 to $1,750. The most valuable specimens are those with full Red surfaces, which can command between $180 and $55,000 depending on grade.

    Error varieties and exceptional specimens can command even higher prices, particularly at specialized auctions.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is a 1919-S penny rare?" >}}
    The 1919-S penny is considered uncommon but not extremely rare in circulated grades. With a mintage of 139,760,000, there are still many examples available to collectors today. However, the 1919-S becomes genuinely rare in high uncirculated grades, particularly with original red color.

    In numismatic terms, the 1919-S penny is classified as a "semi-key" date in the Lincoln cent series. While not as rare as the famous key dates like the 1909-S VDB, 1914-D, or 1931-S, it is significantly scarcer than most common dates, especially in Mint State grades MS65 and above.

    According to PCGS population reports, fewer than 100 examples have been certified in MS65 Red or better, making high-grade red specimens truly rare and valuable to collectors.

    To determine if your 1919-S penny is potentially valuable, check these key indicators:

    1. **Mint Mark**: Confirm it has an "S" mint mark below the date on the obverse (front) side of the coin.
    
    2. **Condition**: Look for:
       - Sharp details in Lincoln's hair and the wheat ears
       - Minimal wear on high points (cheek, jaw, hair)
       - Original surfaces (not cleaned or damaged)
       - Some remaining luster or original color
    
    3. **Color**: Copper cents are categorized as:
       - Brown (least valuable)
       - Red-Brown (medium value)
       - Red (most valuable)
    
    4. **Error Varieties**: Examine with a magnifying glass for:
       - Doubled features on date or lettering
       - Repunched mint mark (S over S)
       - Die cracks or cuds
       - Off-center strikes
    
    5. **Strike Quality**: The 1919-S often has weak strikes, so examples with full, sharp details are more valuable.

    If your coin shows positive signs in several of these categories, consider having it professionally evaluated by a coin dealer or through third-party grading services like PCGS or NGC, especially if it appears uncirculated or has error characteristics.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the most valuable 1919 wheat penny?" >}}
    Among the three mint varieties of 1919 wheat pennies (Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco), the most valuable in absolute terms is typically a perfect gem 1919-D (Denver) cent in MS67 Red condition, which can be worth $30,000 to $60,000.

    However, the 1919-S can approach or even exceed these values in the absolute highest grades. The most valuable 1919-S penny would be:

    1. An MS67+ Red specimen with 100% original mint luster
    2. Perfectly struck with full details
    3. Virtually flawless surfaces
    4. Certified by PCGS or NGC

    Such a coin could potentially sell for $50,000 to $75,000 at auction, according to recent auction results for comparable condition rarity Lincoln cents.

    For error coins, a major doubled die 1919-S in high grade could potentially exceed $100,000, though such varieties are extremely rare and few (if any) major doubled dies have been documented for the 1919-S issue.

    The most valuable regular-issue Lincoln wheat pennies by date and mint mark include:

    1. **1909-S VDB**: $750+ in circulated condition, $2,000+ in uncirculated
    2. **1914-D**: $300+ in circulated condition, $1,500+ in uncirculated
    3. **1922 Plain** (No D): $500+ in circulated condition, $2,000+ in uncirculated
    4. **1931-S**: $100+ in circulated condition, $150+ in uncirculated
    5. **1909-S**: $100+ in circulated condition, $250+ in uncirculated
    6. **1955 Doubled Die Obverse**: $1,000+ in circulated condition, $2,000+ in uncirculated
    7. **1924-D**: $35+ in circulated condition, $200+ in uncirculated
    8. **1911-S**: $25+ in circulated condition, $200+ in uncirculated
    9. **1926-S**: $20+ in circulated condition, $150+ in uncirculated
    10. **1919-D**: $1.20+ in circulated condition, $150+ in uncirculated

    The 1919-S ranks in the second tier of valuable Lincoln wheat cents. While not among the top five most valuable, it still commands significant premiums in higher grades, particularly with original red color.

    For absolute highest values, the 1943 bronze cent (erroneously struck on bronze instead of steel) and 1944 steel cent (erroneously struck on steel instead of bronze) are worth $100,000+ even in circulated grades.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the error list for 1919-S wheat pennies?" >}}
    Known errors and varieties for the 1919-S wheat penny include:

    1. **Doubled Die Obverse (DDO)**: Several minor doubled die varieties showing doubling on the date, LIBERTY, or IN GOD WE TRUST. No major DDOs like the famous 1955 variety are currently documented.

    2. **Doubled Die Reverse (DDR)**: Some examples show doubling on the wheat ears or lettering on the reverse.

    3. **Repunched Mint Mark (RPM)**: Several varieties exist where the S mint mark was punched multiple times at slightly different positions. These are classified by how many times the mint mark was punched and the position of the secondary marks.

    4. **Die Cracks and Cuds**: Late-state die breaks created raised lines or chunks on some coins. Major cuds (where a piece of the die broke away) can add significant value.

    5. **Off-Center Strikes**: Coins struck off-center by 5-50%. Those with the date and mint mark visible command the highest premiums.

    6. **Lamination Errors**: Some 1919-S cents show planchet laminations where layers of the copper separated before or during striking.

    7. **Clipped Planchets**: Examples with curved clips where the planchet cutter overlapped a previously cut area.

    8. **Struck Through Errors**: Coins struck through grease, cloth, or other materials that left an impression or missing detail on the finished coin.

    These errors vary significantly in rarity and value. Most minor repunched mint marks or small die cracks add modest premiums of 20-50% over normal values, while major errors like significant off-centers can multiply the value several times.
