Royal typewriters represent an iconic piece of American industrial history, coveted by collectors for their craftsmanship, historical significance, and aesthetic appeal. Whether you've discovered a Royal typewriter in an attic, inherited one from a relative, or are looking to start a collection, understanding its potential value is essential. This comprehensive guide will help you identify your Royal typewriter model and determine its worth in today's collector market.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Introduction to Royal Typewriters" level="2" >}}
  Founded in 1904, the Royal Typewriter Company quickly established itself as one of America's premier typewriter manufacturers, producing high-quality machines that competed with established brands like Underwood and Remington.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Identifying Your Royal Typewriter Model" level="2" >}}
  Before you can determine the value of your Royal typewriter, you'll need to identify exactly which model you have and when it was manufactured.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Royal typewriter with Magic Margin feature from the late 1930s](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-royal-typewriter-value/old-royal-typewriter-value-image-2_IIW3n_Db5.png)

### Serial Number Location

The serial number is crucial for identifying the age of your Royal typewriter. On most Royal models, you can find the serial number:

- On standard models: Under the right side of the carriage when you slide it to the left
- On portable models: On the frame under the ribbon cover or on the back panel
- On some models: On a small plate attached to the back or bottom of the machine

Once you have located the serial number, you can reference it against the [Typewriter Database](https://typewriterdatabase.com/royal.72.typewriter-serial-number-database) to determine the year of manufacture.

### Age and Rarity

Generally, Royal typewriters from the 1900s through the 1930s command higher prices due to their age and relative scarcity. However, rarity isn't strictly determined by age:

- Pre-1920 models are typically the most valuable due to their scarcity
- Limited production models or special editions have premium value
- Models with unusual features or design elements can command higher prices
- Common office models from the 1940s-1960s tend to be less valuable despite their age

### Condition Assessment

The condition of your Royal typewriter significantly impacts its value. Collectors prize machines in excellent original condition or those that have been professionally restored.

  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Original documentation or manuals are included" /  >}}

### Aesthetic Appeal and Unique Features

Royal typewriters with distinctive visual appeal or special features often command premium prices:

- Glass-sided keys (common on pre-1940s models)
- Unique or rare color combinations
- Art Deco styling elements
- Custom or special edition models
- Unusual keyboard layouts or special typefaces

### Functionality

Working typewriters are generally more valuable than non-working ones, though exceptionally rare models may still have value even if non-functional. Many collectors prefer machines that can be used for typing rather than serving as mere display pieces.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Royal Typewriter Price Ranges" level="2" >}}

{{< content-modules/faq title="Frequently Asked Questions About Royal Typewriter Values" id="royal-typewriter-faqs" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell how old my Royal Typewriter is?" >}}
    The best way to determine the age of your Royal typewriter is by using the serial number. Look for the serial number on the frame under the right end of the carriage (when moved to the left), or on the back of portable models. Once you have the serial number, consult the Royal Typewriter database at [typewriterdatabase.com](https://typewriterdatabase.com/royal.72.typewriter-serial-number-database) to find the corresponding production year.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the most valuable Royal typewriter model?" >}}
    Generally, the earliest Royal models (particularly the Royal 1 from 1906) are the most valuable, potentially worth $2,000-$5,000+ in excellent condition. Other highly valued models include the Royal Grand from the 1930s and early portables with glass keys from the 1920s-1930s. Royal typewriters with documented celebrity ownership or historical significance can command even higher prices.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are electric Royal typewriters worth anything?" >}}
    Electric Royal typewriters typically have lower collector value than manual models, usually selling for $50-$200 depending on condition. Collectors generally prefer the craftsmanship and mechanical nature of manual typewriters. However, some early electric models from the 1950s or unusual variants might command higher prices.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What are the different models of Royal typewriters?" >}}
    Royal produced numerous models throughout its history, including standard office models (Royal 1, Royal 5, Royal 10, KHM, KMM), portable models (Royal P, Royal Portable, Quiet Deluxe, Arrow, Futura, Safari), and later electric models. Each model often had multiple versions and variants released over years or decades. The company introduced innovations like Touch Control (1930s) and Magic Margin (1939) across multiple model lines.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where is the serial number on a Royal typewriter?" >}}
    On standard Royal typewriter models, the serial number is typically located on the frame under the right end of the carriage. Slide the carriage to the left to reveal it. On portable models, the serial number may be on the back panel or under the ribbon cover. Some later models may have the serial number on a small plate attached to the bottom or back of the machine.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is my 1950s Royal typewriter valuable?" >}}
    A 1950s Royal typewriter typically sells for between $50-$200 in working condition, with fully restored examples potentially reaching $300-$350. The Royal Quiet Deluxe is among the more valuable 1950s models, especially in unusual colors or with special features. Models with original case, documentation, and excellent condition command premium prices. If professionally reconditioned, add $75-$150 to the base value.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I clean and maintain my Royal typewriter?" >}}
    For basic cleaning, first use compressed air to remove dust and debris. Gently clean the exterior with a soft cloth slightly dampened with mild soap solution, avoiding excess moisture. For mechanical parts, use appropriate typewriter oil (not WD-40) on moving components. The platen (rubber roller) can be cleaned with specialized rubber rejuvenator. For significant repairs or restoration, consider consulting a professional typewriter repair specialist rather than attempting complex disassembly.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes a Royal typewriter more valuable than average?" >}}
    Several factors can significantly increase a Royal typewriter's value: excellent original condition, rare models or variants, early manufacturing dates (especially pre-1930s), unusual colors or design features, glass keys, original case and documentation, documented provenance or historical significance, and professional restoration. Additionally, models with working specialized features like Touch Control or Magic Margin in perfect condition command premium prices.

  Royal typewriters remain iconic symbols of 20th-century innovation and design, with enduring appeal to collectors, writers, and design enthusiasts.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Royal typewriters occupy a special place in the history of American office equipment, with their distinctive designs and mechanical innovations making them highly sought after by collectors.

By properly identifying, maintaining, and (if necessary) restoring your Royal typewriter, you can preserve both its financial value and its historical significance for future generations.

For those looking to sell, being armed with knowledge about your specific model and its place in the Royal typewriter story will help ensure you receive fair market value. And for collectors, each Royal typewriter acquired represents not just a piece of mechanical ingenuity, but a tangible connection to the evolution of communication technology throughout the 20th century.
