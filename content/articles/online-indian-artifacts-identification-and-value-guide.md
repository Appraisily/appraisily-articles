{{< content-modules/section-header title="Identifying Projectile Points and Arrowheads" level="2" >}}
  Arrowheads and projectile points are among the most commonly collected Native American artifacts and have distinctive features that aid in identification.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Identifying projectile points requires attention to several key characteristics:

### Material Composition

Most arrowheads were crafted from various types of stone, including:
- Flint and chert
- Obsidian
- Quartz
- Jasper
- Petrified wood

The type of stone used often correlates with geographic location, as indigenous people typically utilized materials available in their region.

### Point Typology

Projectile points evolved over thousands of years, with distinct styles corresponding to different cultural periods:

{{< visual-modules/timeline title="Evolution of Native American Projectile Points" >}}
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="13,000-9,000 BCE" title="Paleo-Indian Period" >}}
    The earliest arrowheads include Clovis, Folsom, and other fluted point styles. These are characterized by a distinctive groove or "flute" at the base to aid in hafting to a spear.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="9,000-1,000 BCE" title="Archaic Period" >}}
    A wide variety of stemmed and notched points emerged, including Kirk, Savannah River, and Lamoka styles. These show more regional variation than earlier points.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1,000 BCE-500 CE" title="Woodland Period" >}}
    Smaller projectile points became common as bow and arrow technology replaced spear throwers. Madison, Jack's Reef, and Levanna points are typical of this era.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="500-1500 CE" title="Mississippian Period" >}}
    Small triangular points dominated, with styles such as Madison and Cahokia. These small, thin points were designed specifically for use with bows.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
{{< /visual-modules/timeline >}}

### Regional Variations

Point styles vary significantly by region due to different cultural traditions and available materials:

- **Northeast**: Triangular Levanna and Madison points are common in the Woodland Period
- **Southeast**: Distinctive styles include Dalton, Benton, and Savannah River
- **Plains**: Includes Plainview, Scottsbluff, and distinctive corner-notched varieties
- **Southwest**: Desert side-notched, Pinto Basin, and Gypsum Cave points are characteristic
- **Northwest**: Cascade, Windust, and Columbia Corner-Notched points are frequently found

For precise identification of arrowheads and projectile points, the [Arrowhead Identification Database](https://typology.arrowheads.com/) offers a comprehensive reference with over 1,000 point types and 60,000 photographs.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Authenticating Native American Artifacts" level="2" >}}
  With the prevalence of reproductions and forgeries in the market, proper authentication is crucial when collecting Native American artifacts.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Authentication is perhaps the most critical aspect of artifact identification, as it determines both historical significance and monetary value. Here are key methods for authenticating Native American artifacts:

### Surface Patination and Wear

Authentic ancient artifacts typically display:
- Natural patina that develops over centuries
- Mineral deposits consistent with long burial
- Weathering patterns that cannot be easily faked
- Authentic use-wear patterns and edge damage from practical use

### Manufacturing Techniques

Examine how the artifact was made:
- Authentic stone tools show distinctive flaking patterns
- Pottery exhibits traditional construction methods like coil building or paddle-and-anvil techniques
- Evidence of hand tools rather than machine production
- Material composition consistent with pre-industrial technologies

### Professional Authentication

For valuable or significant artifacts, professional authentication is recommended:

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Native American Artifacts" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is there an app to identify Indian artifacts?" >}}
    Yes, there are mobile applications designed to help identify Native American artifacts. One popular option is Arrowhead ID, which allows you to take a picture of an artifact and receive relevant information about it. The app provides details about various historical objects from different Native American traditions. However, while these apps can be helpful starting points, they should be used in conjunction with other reliable resources and, for valuable or significant items, professional authentication.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What Indian artifacts are worth the most money?" >}}
    Clovis points from the Paleo-Indian period (dating back to the last Ice Age, approximately 13,000-11,000 BCE) are among the most valuable Native American artifacts. Only around 10,000 authentic Clovis points have ever been found, making them extremely rare. Particularly well-preserved examples or those with unusual characteristics can sell for tens of thousands of dollars, with the most exceptional specimens reaching six figures at auction.

    Other highly valuable artifacts include:
    - Intact pottery vessels from the Anasazi, Mimbres, and other Southwestern cultures
    - Rare ceremonial objects like bird stones and banner stones
    - Effigy pipes and other ceremonial smoking implements
    - Exceptional examples of beadwork and textile arts
    - Stone sculptures and effigies
    
    The value depends greatly on condition, provenance, rarity, and authentication status.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Why is it illegal to look for arrowheads?" >}}
    It is illegal to collect artifacts, including arrowheads, on public lands in the United States. According to federal laws such as the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA), artifacts found on public landsâ€”including national parks, forests, and BLM landâ€”are protected resources that belong to the public.

    Collecting artifacts disrupts the archaeological record by removing items from their original context, which is crucial for scientific study. When artifacts are removed from their original location, valuable information about the past is permanently lost. This is why federal law prohibits collecting, excavating, or disturbing archaeological resources on public lands without proper permits, which are typically only issued for scientific research purposes.

    However, the legality of collecting artifacts on private property varies by state and local laws. In some states, landowners may legally collect artifacts on their own property, while in others, certain types of sites and artifacts may still be protected.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I verify Native American artifacts?" >}}
    Verifying the authenticity of Native American artifacts involves several steps:

    1. **Professional Authentication**: Organizations like the Indian Artifact Grading Authority (IAGA) provide official certification services. These experts examine artifacts for authenticity based on material, craftsmanship, patination, and other factors.

    2. **Documentation and Provenance**: Establishing a clear history of ownership and collection can significantly strengthen an artifact's authenticity claim.

    3. **Material Analysis**: For significant pieces, scientific testing methods such as lithic sourcing or dating techniques may be appropriate.

    4. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the artifact with authenticated examples in museum collections or reference books can help identify genuine characteristics.

    5. **Surface Examination**: Authentic artifacts typically display natural patination, wear patterns, and aging that are difficult to fake convincingly.

    Having an official certificate from a recognized authentication service will ensure the preservation of the artifact's provenance and historical information. The grade assigned, along with the classification, can be used to determine the approximate value and rarity of the artifact.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I find Native American artifacts legally?" >}}
    There are several legal ways to find and collect Native American artifacts:

    1. **Purchase from Reputable Dealers**: Buy from established dealers who can provide clear provenance information and authentication.

    2. **Attend Specialized Auctions**: Legitimate auction houses offer authenticated Native American artifacts with proper documentation.

    3. **Private Property (with permission)**: In many states, you can search for artifacts on private property with the explicit permission of the landowner, though state laws vary.

    4. **Artifact Shows and Exhibitions**: Attend shows where collectors and dealers gather to buy, sell, and trade artifacts legally.

    5. **Join Archaeological Societies**: Many societies offer supervised field trips and excavations under professional guidance and with proper permits.

    6. **Estate Sales and Inheritance**: Many collections enter the market through estate sales or are passed down through families.

    Remember that regardless of how you acquire artifacts, it's essential to maintain proper documentation of their provenance and to respect all applicable laws and ethical considerations.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes an arrowhead valuable to collectors?" >}}
    Several factors determine an arrowhead's value to collectors:

    1. **Age**: Generally, older points (like Paleo-Indian Clovis or Folsom points) are more valuable than more recent ones.

    2. **Rarity**: Uncommon types, materials, or features command higher prices.

    3. **Condition**: Complete, undamaged points are worth significantly more than broken or heavily reworked examples.

    4. **Size**: Unusually large examples of a particular type often bring premium prices.

    5. **Material**: Points made from attractive or exotic materials (like transparent quartz, obsidian, or colorful jasper) may be worth more than those from common materials.

    6. **Craftsmanship**: Exceptionally well-made points with fine flaking demonstrate advanced skill and are more desirable.

    7. **Provenance**: Documented history of where and when the point was found adds significant value.

    8. **Authentication**: Professional certification confirming authenticity increases value substantially.

    9. **Special Features**: Unusual characteristics like distinctive fluting, exceptional symmetry, or rare notching patterns can enhance value.

    The most valuable arrowheads combine several of these factorsâ€”for example, a large, perfect condition Clovis point made from an attractive material, with documented provenance and professional authentication.
