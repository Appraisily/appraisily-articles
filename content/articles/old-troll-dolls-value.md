## The History of Troll Dolls

{{< content-modules/section-header title="From Danish Woodcarving to Global Phenomenon" level="2" >}}
  Understanding the evolution of troll dolls helps collectors identify valuable vintage pieces and appreciate their cultural significance.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

{{< visual-modules/timeline title="Evolution of Troll Dolls" >}}
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1956" title="Original Creation" >}}
    Danish woodcutter Thomas Dam creates the first troll doll from wood for his daughter. These larger, more pliable dolls were the precursors to the mass-produced versions.

  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1959" title="Commercial Production Begins" >}}
    Dam begins producing smaller plastic versions called "Dam Things." These early vinyl trolls, now known as Dam trolls, are among the most valuable to collectors.

  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1960s" title="American Troll Craze" >}}
    Troll dolls explode in popularity in the United States. Due to copyright issues, many American companies begin producing their own versions.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1980s-1990s" title="Troll Revival" >}}
    Troll dolls experience a major comeback with companies like Russ, Ace Novelty, and Norfin producing millions of new varieties, including Treasure Trolls with jeweled navels.

Thomas Dam's original creation has spawned decades of colorful variations. The earliest Dam trolls are the most prized by serious collectors, but even mass-produced versions from the 1960s through the 1990s can hold significant value if they're in good condition or have unique characteristics.

The Danish creator originally made the dolls from natural materials like wood. As demand grew, production moved to vinyl and plastic, allowing for greater production volume and eventually leading to a worldwide phenomenon.

## Identifying Valuable Troll Dolls

{{< content-modules/section-header title="What Makes a Troll Doll Valuable" level="2" >}}
  Several factors contribute to a troll doll's value in today's collectibles market. Understanding these elements will help you assess your own collection.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Manufacturer and Origin

The most valuable troll dolls are typically those made by Dam Things (often marked with "© DAM" or "© T. DAM" on the back or foot). These original Danish trolls, especially those from the late 1950s and early 1960s, can be worth hundreds of dollars. American companies like Uneeda, Russ, and Norfin produced more affordable versions that have varying collectible value today.

### Age and Rarity

Early Dam trolls from the late 1950s through the 1960s typically command the highest prices. Limited editions, unusual designs, and trolls in animal forms (such as elephants, giraffes, or monkeys) are particularly sought after. The mini-Dam trolls, especially those with unusual coloring or features, can fetch impressive sums at auction.

### Condition Matters

  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Free from odors, stains, or damage" / />}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### Special Features and Variations

Certain characteristics can significantly increase a troll doll's value:

1. **Unusual hair colors**: While rainbow and bright colors are common, natural hair colors or rare shades can increase value
2. **Animal trolls**: Dam produced elephant, giraffe, and monkey trolls that are highly collectible
3. **Unique eye features**: Early trolls with glass or unusual eyes command premium prices
4. **Original clothing**: Trolls still wearing their original felt or fabric outfits are more valuable
5. **Special materials**: Amber, glitter, or flocked versions often sell for more than standard models

## How to Identify Original Dam Trolls

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Authenticating Valuable Dam Trolls" level="2" >}}
  Distinguishing authentic Dam trolls from later reproductions is crucial for proper valuation. Here are the key identification markers.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Original Dam trolls have several distinguishing characteristics:

1. **Markings**: Look for "© DAM," "© T. DAM," or "© DAM THINGS" stamped on the back or foot. Earlier models may have "MADE IN DENMARK" imprinted.

2. **Material**: Authentic Dam trolls are made from soft, high-quality vinyl that feels different from harder plastic reproductions. The material has a distinctive tactile quality.

3. **Facial Features**: Original Dam trolls have distinctive facial expressions with deeply inset eyes (often glass in the earliest versions), a broad nose, and a slightly open mouth showing teeth.

4. **Construction**: The hair is typically inserted directly into the head rather than attached via a plug, and the arms and legs are often jointed in early models.

5. **Size and Weight**: Original Dam trolls have a substantial feel and range from 3 inches to over 12 inches in height, with the most common vintage sizes being around 3-5 inches.

If you believe you have an authentic Dam troll, it's worth consulting a specialist or referencing detailed collector guides to confirm its authenticity and potential value. The Troll Hole Museum in Alliance, Ohio—home to the world's largest collection of troll dolls—offers resources for identification and authentication.

## Selling Your Vintage Troll Dolls

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Where and How to Sell Collectible Trolls" level="2" >}}
  If you've discovered valuable trolls in your collection, here are the best platforms and approaches for selling them.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Best Platforms for Selling

1. **eBay**: The most popular marketplace for troll dolls, with a wide audience of collectors. Perfect for both common and rare specimens.
   
2. **Etsy**: Excellent for vintage collectibles, especially if you have authentic Dam trolls or unusual specimens.
   
3. **Specialized Collector Forums**: Websites and Facebook groups dedicated to troll collectors offer targeted audiences willing to pay premium prices for special pieces.
   
4. **Auction Houses**: For extremely rare or valuable Dam trolls worth hundreds of dollars, traditional auction houses might be appropriate.
   
5. **The Troll Hole Museum**: This museum maintains the world's largest collection of troll dolls and sometimes purchases exceptional specimens for their collection.

### Presentation Tips for Maximum Value

- **Clean Gently**: Use a soft cloth with mild soap and water to carefully clean vinyl bodies. For hair, use a small amount of fabric softener diluted in water to restore the fluff.
  
- **Photograph Thoroughly**: Take clear photos from multiple angles, including any manufacturer marks, special features, and original clothing or accessories.
  
- **Provide Detailed Descriptions**: Include measurements, suspected age, manufacturer (if known), and any special characteristics that might increase value.
  
- **Document Provenance**: If you have original packaging, purchase receipts, or knowledge of when and where the troll was acquired, include this information.
  
- **Research Before Pricing**: Look up recently sold similar items to establish a realistic price range rather than setting an arbitrary value.

## Collecting and Preserving Vintage Troll Dolls

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Building and Maintaining a Troll Collection" level="2" >}}
  Whether you're starting a collection or preserving inherited trolls, these tips will help maintain their condition and value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Storage and Preservation

1. **Avoid Direct Sunlight**: UV rays can fade hair colors and deteriorate vinyl over time.
   
2. **Control Temperature and Humidity**: Extreme conditions can cause vinyl to crack or become sticky. Aim for moderate, stable conditions.
   
3. **Dust Protection**: Display cases or cabinets help prevent dust accumulation, which can be difficult to remove from troll hair.
   
4. **Handling Practices**: Always handle vintage trolls with clean hands, and avoid touching the hair too frequently to prevent oils from breaking down the fibers.
   
5. **Original Packaging**: If you have trolls in their original packaging, consider keeping them that way, as mint-in-box specimens command significantly higher prices.

### Building a Valuable Collection

For those interested in collecting troll dolls as an investment or hobby:

1. **Focus on a Niche**: Specialize in a specific era, manufacturer, or type (like animal trolls or profession-themed trolls).
   
2. **Research Authentication**: Learn to distinguish genuine Dam trolls from reproductions and later manufacturers.
   
3. **Network with Other Collectors**: Join online forums and groups dedicated to troll collecting to share knowledge and find rare pieces.
   
4. **Document Your Collection**: Keep detailed records of each troll's characteristics, purchase information, and estimated value.
   
5. **Consider Insurance**: For valuable collections, specialized collectibles insurance may be appropriate.

  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do you identify a troll doll?" >}}
    Troll dolls are characterized by their distinct design featuring a small body, large head, and long, brightly colored hair. Beyond these basics, identification factors include:
    
    - Manufacturer marks (look for "© DAM" or other company marks on the foot or back)
    - Material quality and feel (early Dam trolls use a distinct soft vinyl)

    - Jointed limbs (many original Dam trolls have articulated arms and legs)
    
    The most valuable trolls are those that can be authenticated as original Dam products from the 1950s-1960s, which have a different quality and appearance from later mass-produced versions.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the oldest troll doll?" >}}
    The oldest troll dolls date back to 1956 when Danish woodcutter and fisherman Thomas Dam created the first troll doll for his daughter. These original trolls were hand-carved from wood and were larger than later commercial versions.
    
    In 1959, Dam began mass-producing smaller plastic versions called "Dam Things." These early vinyl trolls from the late 1950s and early 1960s are the oldest commercially produced troll dolls and are highly prized by collectors today. They feature a distinctive design and quality that differs from later reproductions.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I clean my vintage troll dolls without damaging them?" >}}
    Cleaning vintage troll dolls requires gentle handling:
    
    For the vinyl body:
    - Use a soft cloth lightly dampened with mild soap and water
    - Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive materials
    - Pat dry completely after cleaning
    
    For the hair:
    - Create a solution of lukewarm water with a small amount of fabric softener
    - Gently comb through with a wide-toothed comb while damp
    - Allow to air dry completely, then fluff with fingers
    
    Never submerge vintage trolls fully in water, as this can damage internal structures or cause deterioration of the vinyl. For extremely valuable specimens, consider consulting a professional toy restorer.
