        text: >-
          A 1912 penny's value ranges from $1-$2 in worn condition to $15+ in
          uncirculated condition. The 1912-D penny is worth $5-$10 in circulated
          condition and $50+ in mint state. The 1912-S penny is the most
          valuable, worth $15-$25 in circulated condition and $100+ in
          uncirculated condition. Rare error coins and premium examples can be
          worth significantly more.

        text: >-
          Check for the mint mark (D or S) on the reverse under the date, as
          1912-S pennies are the most valuable. Look at the condition -
          uncirculated coins with original luster are worth more. Examine for
          errors like doubled dies, off-center strikes, or repunched mint marks
          which can significantly increase value. The color (red, red-brown, or
          brown) also affects value, with red specimens commanding the highest
          prices.

      acceptedAnswer:
        '@type': Answer
        text: >-
          The mint mark on a 1912 Lincoln Wheat penny is located on the reverse
          (tails) side of the coin, below the date. A 'D' indicates it was
          minted in Denver, while an 'S' means it was produced at the San
          Francisco Mint. Pennies with no mint mark were struck at the
          Philadelphia Mint.

## Introduction to the 1912 Lincoln Penny

The 1912 Lincoln penny represents an important early issue in the Lincoln Wheat cent series, which was first introduced in 1909. Now over a century old, these copper pennies have become prized collectibles with values significantly above their face value. Whether you've discovered one in an old coin collection, received it in change, or are considering adding one to your numismatic collection, understanding the true value of a 1912 penny is essential.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything you need to know about 1912 Lincoln cents, including their history, design features, current market values across different mint marks and conditions, notable errors, and authentication tips. By the end of this article, you'll have the knowledge to accurately determine what your 1912 penny is worth in today's collector market.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="History of the 1912 Lincoln Wheat Penny" level="2" >}}
The 1912 penny is part of the Lincoln Wheat cent series designed by Victor David Brenner, which began in 1909 and continued until 1958. By 1912, the Lincoln cent design was in its fourth year of production, having already established itself as a popular coin with the American public.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

During this era, pennies were struck at three different U.S. Mint facilities: Philadelphia (no mint mark), Denver (D mint mark), and San Francisco (S mint mark). The Philadelphia Mint produced the highest quantity, while the branch mints manufactured fewer coins, making the 1912-D and 1912-S pennies more valuable to collectors today.

![1912 Wheat Penny showing mint mark location on reverse](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1912-penny-worth/how-much-is-a-1912-penny-worth-image-2_EAkSGCTr-.png)

The early Lincoln cents, including the 1912 issue, were composed of 95% copper and 5% tin and zinc, giving them a distinctive reddish-brown appearance. This composition remained consistent until 1943, when wartime demands for copper led to the production of steel cents for that year only.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Design Features of the 1912 Lincoln Cent" level="2" >}}
Understanding the design elements of the 1912 Lincoln cent is crucial for proper identification and authentication. These distinctive features help collectors distinguish genuine 1912 pennies from other years in the series.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Obverse (Front) Design

The obverse features Abraham Lincoln's right-facing portrait, which was based on a plaque created by sculptor Victor David Brenner. Around the top edge is the motto "IN GOD WE TRUST." To the left of Lincoln's portrait is the word "LIBERTY," and to the right is the date "1912."

### Reverse (Back) Design

The reverse design features two wheat stalks framing the denomination "ONE CENT" in the center. Above this is "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA," and below is the Latin motto "E PLURIBUS UNUM" (meaning "Out of Many, One"). On 1912-D and 1912-S pennies, the mint mark appears below the date on the obverse side.

### Mint Marks and Their Locations

- **No Mint Mark**: Produced at the Philadelphia Mint
- **D Mint Mark**: Produced at the Denver Mint (appears below the date)
- **S Mint Mark**: Produced at the San Francisco Mint (appears below the date)

### Physical Specifications

- **Diameter**: 19 mm
- **Weight**: 3.11 grams
- **Composition**: 95% copper, 5% tin and zinc

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1912 Penny Value by Mint Mark" level="2" >}}
The value of a 1912 penny varies significantly based on the mint mark and condition. Coins from the Denver and San Francisco mints are generally more valuable due to their lower mintage numbers.

### 1912 Philadelphia (No Mint Mark) Penny Value

The 1912 penny with no mint mark was produced in the largest quantity, with over 68 million coins struck at the Philadelphia Mint. In worn (circulated) condition, these coins typically range in value from $1.25 to $10, depending on the level of wear. Well-preserved examples in uncirculated condition can be worth $30 to $60 or more.

For premium quality examples with full red coloration (designated as "RD" by grading services), the values increase significantly:
- MS-63 RD: $60-$75
- MS-64 RD: $100-$125
- MS-65 RD: $300-$350
- MS-66 RD: $800-$1,000

### 1912-D Penny Value

With a mintage of approximately 10.4 million, the 1912-D penny is considerably scarcer than its Philadelphia counterpart. In worn condition, these coins typically sell for $7 to $65, depending on how much detail remains. Uncirculated examples are particularly valuable:
- MS-63 RD: $250-$300
- MS-64 RD: $400-$500
- MS-65 RD: $1,000-$1,200
- MS-66 RD: $4,500-$5,500

In November 2017, an MS-66 BN (brown) 1912-D penny sold for $1,540 at auction. The PCGS price guide currently values MS-66 BN examples at approximately $1,800.

### 1912-S Penny Value

The 1912-S penny is the key date from this year, with only 4.4 million produced. This makes it the most valuable of the three mint varieties in all conditions:
- G-4 (Good) condition: $24-$30
- F-12 (Fine) condition: $45-$55
- EF-40 (Extremely Fine): $75-$100
- AU-58 (About Uncirculated): $150-$225
- MS-63 RD: $350-$400
- MS-64 RD: $650-$800
- MS-65 RD: $2,000-$2,500

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Key 1912 Penny Statistics" columns="3" / /  >}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors Affecting 1912 Penny Value" level="2" >}}
Several key factors influence the value of a 1912 Lincoln cent beyond just the mint mark. Understanding these variables will help you better assess what your coin might be worth.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Condition (Grade)

The grade or condition of a coin is perhaps the most significant factor affecting its value. Numismatic grading follows a scale from Poor (P-1) to Perfect Mint State (MS-70). For 1912 pennies, key grade distinctions include:

- **Circulated Grades**: Good (G), Very Good (VG), Fine (F), Very Fine (VF), Extremely Fine (EF), and About Uncirculated (AU)
- **Uncirculated Grades**: Mint State (MS) grades from MS-60 through MS-67

  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Minimal wear on high points" /  >}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### Color Designation

Lincoln cents receive a color designation from grading services that significantly impacts their value:

- **Brown (BN)**: Coins that have completely lost their original mint red color
- **Red-Brown (RB)**: Coins that retain 5% to 95% of their original mint red color
- **Red (RD)**: Coins that retain at least 95% of their original mint red color

Red specimens command the highest premiums, often selling for several times more than their brown counterparts in the same numerical grade.

### Strike Quality

Well-struck 1912 pennies with sharp, clear details are more valuable than weakly struck examples. Look for:
- Full definition in Lincoln's hair and beard
- Clear, distinct wheat stalks on the reverse
- Sharp lettering throughout

### Mint Errors and Varieties

Errors and varieties can significantly increase a 1912 penny's value:

1. **Doubled Die**: Shows doubling on the obverse or reverse design elements
2. **Repunched Mint Mark (RPM)**: Shows evidence of a mint mark being punched multiple times in slightly different positions
3. **Die Cracks**: Raised lines on the coin caused by cracked dies
4. **Off-Center Strikes**: Coins struck off-center, displaying partial designs

For example, a 1912 penny with a significant die crack or an off-center strike of 15% or more could be worth $50 to $150 depending on the severity and condition.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Notable 1912 Penny Errors and Varieties" level="2" >}}
While not as well-known for errors as some other years, the 1912 penny does have some interesting varieties and errors that command premium prices.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### 1912 Doubled Die Obverse

Some 1912 pennies show minor doubling on the obverse, particularly in the date and lettering. While not as dramatic as the famous 1955 Doubled Die, these varieties can still command a premium of 25-50% over standard examples in similar condition.

### 1912-S/S Repunched Mint Mark

This variety shows the S mint mark punched over another S in a slightly different position. The repunched mint mark can be seen under magnification, with the original S slightly offset from the final position. These coins typically sell for 20-40% more than standard 1912-S pennies.

### Die Crack Errors

Late-die state 1912 pennies sometimes exhibit significant die cracks, appearing as raised lines across the surface of the coin. Major die cracks that cross important design elements can increase the value by 10-30% depending on their prominence.

### Off-Center Strikes

1912 pennies struck off-center are rare but do exist. The value depends on the percentage off-center and whether the date and mint mark are still visible:
- 5-10% off-center: $25-$50
- 20-50% off-center (with date visible): $100-$300
- 50%+ off-center (with date visible): $300-$600

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How to Identify Authentic 1912 Pennies" level="2" >}}
Given their age and value, 1912 pennies can sometimes be targets for counterfeiting or alteration. Here are key authentication points to ensure your coin is genuine.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Genuine Design Features

Authentic 1912 Lincoln cents have these characteristics:
- Correct font style for the date and lettering
- Proper spacing between design elements
- Correct positioning of the mint mark (when present)

### Weight and Size Testing

Genuine 1912 pennies should:
- Weigh approximately 3.11 grams
- Measure 19 mm in diameter
- Have a plain (smooth) edge

### Authentication Tips

1. **Examine the Mint Mark**: For D and S varieties, check that the mint mark appears natural and hasn't been added afterward. Added mint marks often look irregular or show evidence of tooling around them.

2. **Check for Cleaning or Alteration**: Artificially brightened or cleaned coins may show hairline scratches or an unnatural color.

3. **Magnetic Test**: 1912 pennies are copper and should not be attracted to a magnet. If your coin is magnetic, it's likely counterfeit.

4. **Professional Authentication**: For high-value examples (particularly uncirculated 1912-S pennies), consider professional authentication and grading through services like PCGS or NGC.

Whether you're looking to add a 1912 penny to your collection or sell one you already own, these tips will help you navigate the market effectively.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Buying Tips

1. **Buy Certified for Valuable Examples**: For 1912-S pennies or high-grade examples of any mint mark, purchase coins that have been certified by PCGS, NGC, or ANACS to ensure authenticity and proper grading.

2. **Examine Closely for Problem-Free Coins**: Look for coins that are free from cleaning, environmental damage, or other issues that could affect value.

3. **Compare Multiple Specimens**: When possible, compare multiple examples of similar grade to find the most appealing coin.

4. **Research Current Values**: Check recent auction results and dealer listings to ensure you're paying a fair market price.

5. **Beware of Altered Mint Marks**: Be cautious of 1912-S pennies priced too low, as they may have added mint marks.

### Selling Tips

1. **Know Your Coin's Grade**: Have a realistic understanding of your coin's condition; consider professional grading for valuable specimens.

2. **Choose the Right Venue**: For common 1912 pennies in circulated grades, local coin shops may be convenient. For better examples, consider online auctions or specialized coin forums.

3. **Properly Photograph Your Coin**: If selling online, provide clear, well-lit photos from multiple angles.

4. **Disclose Any Issues**: Be upfront about any problems with the coin to maintain your reputation as a seller.

5. **Set Realistic Prices**: Research comparable sales to price your coin appropriately.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Collecting 1912 Lincoln Cents" level="2" >}}
The 1912 Lincoln cent makes an excellent addition to several different coin collecting approaches. Here are some popular ways to incorporate these historic pennies into your collection.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Lincoln Cent Date Sets

Many collectors pursue complete date sets of Lincoln cents, either focusing on just one coin per year or collecting all mint marks. In a basic date set, a single 1912 penny (typically the more common Philadelphia issue) would represent that year.

### Mint Mark Sets

Collectors focusing on mint mark varieties would seek all three 1912 issues: Philadelphia (no mint mark), Denver (D), and San Francisco (S). This "P-D-S" approach highlights the differences in production and rarity across the U.S. Mint facilities.

### Early Wheat Cent Collections

Some numismatists focus specifically on early Lincoln Wheat cents from 1909-1933. Within this specialized collection, the 1912-S penny represents one of the key semi-keys to complete the set.

### Condition-Based Collections

Advanced collectors might focus on assembling high-grade examples of each year and mint mark, seeking coins in Mint State (MS-63 to MS-66) with original red coloration when possible.

### Storage and Preservation

To maintain your 1912 penny's condition and value:

1. Store in archival-quality holders (flips, albums, or slabs)
2. Avoid touching the surface with bare hands (use cotton gloves or hold by edges)
3. Keep in a stable environment free from temperature and humidity fluctuations
4. Never clean your coins, as this significantly reduces their value

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About 1912 Penny Values" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my 1912 penny is valuable?" >}}
    Your 1912 penny's value depends primarily on its mint mark and condition. Check below the date for a D or S mint mark, as these are worth more than Philadelphia coins with no mint mark. In general, 1912-S pennies are the most valuable, followed by 1912-D, then 1912 with no mint mark.

    Beyond mint marks, look at the coin's condition. Uncirculated coins with original red color command the highest premiums. Visible errors like doubled dies or off-center strikes can also significantly increase value.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where is the mint mark located on a 1912 penny?" >}}
    On 1912 Lincoln cents, the mint mark (D for Denver or S for San Francisco) is located on the obverse (front) of the coin, below the date. If there is no mint mark present, the coin was produced at the Philadelphia Mint, which did not use a mint mark on cents during this period.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes a 1912 penny rare or valuable?" >}}
    Several factors make a 1912 penny particularly valuable:

    1. Mint mark (S being the most valuable, followed by D)
    2. Condition (higher grades command significant premiums)
    3. Color (red specimens are worth more than red-brown or brown)
    4. Errors or varieties (doubled dies, repunched mint marks, etc.)
    5. Strike quality (well-struck coins with full details)

    The most valuable 1912 pennies are those that combine rarity (like the 1912-S) with exceptional preservation (high Mint State grades with original red color).

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my 1912 penny is uncirculated?" >}}
    An uncirculated (Mint State) 1912 penny shows no evidence of wear from circulation. Look for these characteristics:

    1. No flatness or wear on Lincoln's cheek, jaw, or beard
    2. Original mint luster present across the coin's surface
    3. No smoothing on high points like Lincoln's hair or the wheat stalks
    4. Possible contact marks (small nicks) but no actual wear from circulation

    The presence of original mint "red" color is also often associated with uncirculated coins, though many uncirculated cents have naturally toned to brown over the past century.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the most valuable 1912 penny ever sold?" >}}
    Among the most valuable 1912 pennies sold at auction was a 1912-S graded MS-66 RD (Red) by PCGS that sold for over $10,000. For the 1912-D, an MS-67 RD example would likely command $25,000 or more if offered for sale, though such high-grade specimens rarely appear on the market.

    The record prices for 1912 pennies continue to increase as the coins become older and high-grade examples become increasingly scarce.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is my 1912 penny worth getting professionally graded?" >}}
    Professional grading is recommended for:

    1. Any 1912-S penny in Fine condition or better
    2. Any 1912-D penny in Extremely Fine condition or better
    3. Any 1912 (no mint mark) penny that appears uncirculated
    4. Any 1912 penny with visible errors or varieties
    5. Any 1912 penny that retains significant original red color

    For circulated common-date 1912 pennies with no mint mark, the cost of professional grading (typically $20-$30 per coin) may exceed the coin's value, making it economically impractical.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a 1912 penny with no mint mark worth today?" >}}
    A 1912 penny with no mint mark (from Philadelphia) typically ranges in value from:

    - $1.25-$2 in Good (G-4) condition
    - $3-$10 in Fine to Extremely Fine condition
    - $13-$20 in About Uncirculated condition
    - $35-$60 in typical Uncirculated condition
    - $100-$350 for choice Uncirculated (MS-64 to MS-65)
    - $800-$1,000+ for gem Uncirculated (MS-66+)

    Red specimens command higher prices than red-brown or brown examples in the same grade.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What are common errors found on 1912 pennies?" >}}
    Common errors found on 1912 pennies include:

    1. Repunched mint marks (particularly on 1912-S pennies)
    2. Die cracks and breaks
    3. Off-center strikes
    4. Minor doubled dies
    5. Lamination errors (flaking of the coin's surface due to impurities)
    6. Clipped planchets (irregularly shaped blanks)

    While not as famous for errors as some other years, these varieties can add significant value to a 1912 penny when present.

## Conclusion: Is Your 1912 Penny a Hidden Treasure?

The 1912 Lincoln cent represents an important piece of American numismatic history, now well over a century old. While most 1912 pennies in circulated condition remain affordable for beginning collectors, certain specimens—particularly those from the San Francisco and Denver mints in high grades—can be quite valuable.

The most important factors affecting your 1912 penny's value are its mint mark, condition, and color. The 1912-S penny is consistently the most valuable, with even worn examples commanding $25 or more. For all 1912 pennies, uncirculated examples with original red color represent the pinnacle of value, with premium examples reaching into the thousands of dollars.

Whether you're a dedicated numismatist or someone who just discovered a 1912 penny in an old coin jar, understanding these valuation factors helps you appreciate both the historical and monetary significance of these early Lincoln cents. As these coins continue to age and become scarcer, their value is likely to increase, making them both enjoyable collectibles and potentially worthwhile investments.

If you believe you have a particularly valuable 1912 penny, consider professional authentication and grading to confirm its condition and protect your investment. And remember—even if your 1912 penny isn't worth thousands, it still represents a tangible connection to American history from over a century ago, making it a treasure regardless of its monetary value.
