            The value of Norman Rockwell prints is affected by authenticity,
            edition type (limited vs. open), condition, provenance, signature,
            subject matter popularity, size, and current market demand. Limited
            edition prints with certificates of authenticity and those featuring
            iconic Americana subjects typically command higher prices.

            Authentic Norman Rockwell prints can be identified by examining the
            signature, checking for edition numbers on limited prints, looking
            for publisher marks, verifying paper quality and printing technique,
            and reviewing provenance documentation. Certificates of authenticity
            from reputable sources are also important indicators.
