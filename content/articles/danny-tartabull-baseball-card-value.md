Danny Tartabull baseball cards represent an interesting segment of the 1980s and early 1990s sports card market. While not among the most valuable players of his era, certain Tartabull cards—particularly rookie cards and rare variations—have maintained collector interest over the decades. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the values, rarities, and investment potential of Danny Tartabull's baseball cards.

![Danny Tartabull 1987 Topps baseball card](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/danny-tartabull-baseball-card-value/danny-tartabull-baseball-card-value-image-1_t5eWP1Ai1.png)

## Who Is Danny Tartabull?

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Danny Tartabull's MLB Career" level="2" >}}
Before diving into card values, it's helpful to understand the player's career and legacy in baseball.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Danny Tartabull played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball from 1984 to 1997. Known for his power hitting, Tartabull was an All-Star in 1991 and played for several teams including the Seattle Mariners, Kansas City Royals, New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics, Chicago White Sox, and Philadelphia Phillies. While not a Hall of Famer, his solid career numbers and memorable stint with the Yankees have kept his cards relevant in the collecting community.

Tartabull's career highlights include:
- 1991 All-Star selection
- Career .273 batting average
- 262 home runs and 925 RBIs
- 1986 The Sporting News American League Rookie Player of the Year

His moderate star status places his cards in a middle tier of baseball card collecting—not as valuable as superstars like Ken Griffey Jr. or Cal Ripken Jr., but still sought after by team collectors and 1980s-90s baseball enthusiasts.

## Danny Tartabull's Rookie Cards

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Rookie Card Values" level="2" >}}
Rookie cards typically represent the most valuable options for any player. Let's examine Tartabull's rookie cards and their current market values.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Danny Tartabull 1985 Donruss rookie card](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/danny-tartabull-baseball-card-value/danny-tartabull-baseball-card-value-image-2_VuYbgeUif.png)

Tartabull's official rookie cards were released in 1985, with his key rookie appearances in these sets:

{{< data-modules/price-table title="Danny Tartabull Rookie Card Values" description="Current market values for Tartabull's key rookie cards" >}}
<tr>
  <td>1985 Donruss #27</td>
  <td>$1.73 (Raw) / $59.99 (PSA 9)</td>
  <td>Most recognized rookie card</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1985 Fleer #647</td>
  <td>$1-3 (Raw) / $59.99 (PSA 9)</td>
  <td>Considered a true rookie</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1985 Topps #362</td>
  <td>$1-5 (Raw) / $30-45 (PSA 9)</td>
  <td>Popular mainstream rookie</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1984 Cramer Salt Lake City Gulls #170</td>
  <td>$2.52 (Raw) / $10-20 (NM)</td>
  <td>Pre-rookie minor league card</td>
</tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

The 1985 Donruss card is generally considered his primary rookie card among collectors. For high-grade examples (PSA 9 or PSA 10), prices can increase significantly compared to raw cards. In particular, PSA 10 examples of Tartabull's rookie cards can command a substantial premium, often selling for 5-10 times the value of a PSA 9.

## Key Danny Tartabull Cards By Year

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Notable Cards Throughout His Career" level="2" >}}
Beyond rookie cards, several Tartabull issues stand out for their collectibility and value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Danny Tartabull 1991 Topps Desert Shield card](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/danny-tartabull-baseball-card-value/danny-tartabull-baseball-card-value-image-3_muzdaqtwS.png)

### 1980s Cards

The 1980s represent Tartabull's early career cards, including his rookie season and initial years with the Seattle Mariners and Kansas City Royals:

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1980s Danny Tartabull Card Values" description="Market values for key 1980s issues" >}}
<tr>
  <td>1987 Topps #476</td>
  <td>$0.28 (Raw) / $39.00 (PSA 9)</td>
  <td>Popular second-year card</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1987 Topps Tiffany #476</td>
  <td>$0.27 (Raw) / $15-25 (NM)</td>
  <td>Limited premium version</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1988 Donruss Diamond Kings #5</td>
  <td>$1-3 (Raw) / $5-15 (NM)</td>
  <td>Collectible Diamond Kings subset</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1989 Topps #275</td>
  <td>$0.25-1 (Raw) / $2-5 (NM)</td>
  <td>Kansas City Royals era</td>
</tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

The 1987 Topps Tiffany is particularly noteworthy as it was produced in limited quantities (estimated at around 30,000 sets) compared to the regular mass-produced Topps sets of the era. These premium Tiffany cards have glossier fronts and whiter card stock backs.

### 1990s Cards

The 1990s represent Tartabull's prime years and his time with the New York Yankees:

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1990s Danny Tartabull Card Values" description="Market values for key 1990s issues" >}}
<tr>
  <td>1991 Topps Desert Shield #145</td>
  <td>$50-150 (Raw) / $200-300 (PSA 9)</td>
  <td>Rare and highly sought-after variant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1992 Topps #145</td>
  <td>$0.25-1 (Raw) / $2-5 (PSA 9)</td>
  <td>Yankees era card</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1992 O-Pee-Chee</td>
  <td>$1-3 (Raw) / $8-15 (NM)</td>
  <td>Canadian version with limited production</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1994 Upper Deck #273</td>
  <td>$0.25-1 (Raw) / $2-5 (NM)</td>
  <td>Later career Yankees card</td>
</tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

## Rare and Valuable Danny Tartabull Cards

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Premium and Limited Edition Cards" level="2" >}}
Some Tartabull cards stand out for their rarity, special features, or limited production runs.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Danny Tartabull Topps Tiffany card](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/danny-tartabull-baseball-card-value/danny-tartabull-baseball-card-value-image-4_x_v9SeA1W.png)

### 1991 Topps Desert Shield

The 1991 Topps Desert Shield Danny Tartabull is considered his most valuable mainstream card. These cards were distributed to troops during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm and feature a special gold foil stamp. With limited distribution and high loss rate, these cards are quite rare. Raw examples in decent condition typically sell for $50-150, while PSA 9 examples can fetch $200-300.

### Autographed Cards

Authenticated autographed Tartabull cards can command significant premiums:

- PSA/DNA Authenticated autographed rookie card: $159.60
- 1987 Topps with authenticated signature: $25-75 depending on condition

### Error and Variation Cards

A few error cards and variations exist for Tartabull:

- 1987 Topps with print flaw or alignment issue: Small premium over base value
- 1988 Topps with color variation: Slight premium for serious collectors

## Factors Affecting Danny Tartabull Card Values

{{< content-modules/section-header title="What Determines Card Value?" level="2" >}}
Several key factors influence the market value of Tartabull baseball cards.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Card Condition

Condition is perhaps the most critical factor affecting Tartabull card values. Cards in near-mint to mint condition (NM-MT or better) can command significantly higher prices than those with visible wear.

{{< interactive-modules/condition-checklist title="Condition Assessment for Danny Tartabull Cards" description="Check all that apply to determine your card's condition" >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Sharp, well-defined corners with no visible wear" /  >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Card is perfectly centered (50/50 on all sides)" /  >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Surface is free of scratches, print defects, and stains" /  >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Card edges are clean with no chipping or wear" /  >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Card has proper gloss and color saturation" /  >}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### Professional Grading

Professional grading has a substantial impact on Tartabull card values. For example:

- A raw (ungraded) 1985 Donruss rookie might sell for $1-3
- The same card in PSA 9 (Mint) condition: $50-60
- In PSA 10 (Gem Mint) condition: $200-300+

This price escalation for graded cards is particularly pronounced for his rookie cards and rare variations like the 1991 Topps Desert Shield.

### Card Rarity

Rarer cards naturally command higher prices. The hierarchy of rarity for Tartabull cards is typically:

1. 1991 Topps Desert Shield (most valuable)
2. Authenticated autographed cards
3. 1987 Topps Tiffany and other premium sets
4. 1985 rookie cards in high grade
5. Standard issue cards (least valuable)

### Player Popularity

While Tartabull had a solid career, he isn't considered a baseball legend, which affects his card values. However, his cards remain popular among:

- New York Yankees team collectors
- Kansas City Royals team collectors
- 1980s and 1990s baseball card collectors
- Fans who remember his appearance in a "Seinfeld" episode

## Market Trends and Investment Potential

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Value Trends and Future Outlook" level="2" >}}
Understanding current market dynamics can help collectors make informed decisions.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Current Market Analysis

According to recent market data from Collectibles.com:

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Danny Tartabull Card Market Data" columns="3" / /  >}}

- Average Sale Price: $25.04
- Total Sales Volume: $1,051.55
- Recent Price Change: -$5.00 (-13.89%)

This indicates a moderate collector interest with some recent value decline, which is consistent with broader trends in the sports card market for non-superstar players from this era.

### Value Trajectories

The values of Tartabull cards have shown these patterns:

1. **Rookie Cards**: Have maintained relatively stable values with premium graded examples seeing the most consistent demand
2. **Desert Shield Cards**: Continue to appreciate due to their rarity and historical significance
3. **Common Cards**: Have seen declining interest except for pristine graded examples
4. **Autographed Cards**: Show sporadic value increases based on scarcity in the market

### Investment Recommendations

For collectors considering Tartabull cards as investments:

- **Strong Potential**: 1991 Topps Desert Shield in PSA 9-10; Authenticated autographed rookie cards
- **Moderate Potential**: 1985 Rookie cards in PSA 9-10; 1987 Topps Tiffany
- **Limited Potential**: Common issues from 1987-1997 in raw condition

## Common Questions About Danny Tartabull Cards

{{< content-modules/faq title="Frequently Asked Questions" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is Danny Tartabull's most valuable baseball card?" >}}
    The 1991 Topps Desert Shield is typically Danny Tartabull's most valuable mainstream card, especially in high grade. PSA 9 examples can sell for $200-300, while PSA 10 copies are extremely rare and valuable. However, for true collectors, his 1985 rookie cards (particularly Donruss and Fleer) in PSA 10 condition can sometimes exceed Desert Shield values.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I identify a genuine 1991 Topps Desert Shield Tartabull card?" >}}
    Authentic 1991 Topps Desert Shield cards feature a distinctive gold foil shield emblem on the front, typically in the upper right or left corner of the card. The stamping should have consistent depth and clarity. Be wary of counterfeits with painted-on emblems or inconsistent foil application. When in doubt, consider professional authentication through PSA or BGS.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are Danny Tartabull cards a good investment?" >}}
    Danny Tartabull cards represent a mixed investment opportunity. High-grade rookie cards and rare variations like the Desert Shield can show moderate appreciation, but common cards from the overproduced late 80s and early 90s have limited investment potential. The best investment approach is focusing on PSA 9-10 graded rookies and authenticated rare variations rather than bulk purchases of common cards.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Which Danny Tartabull rookie card is considered his official rookie card?" >}}
    Danny Tartabull's 1985 Donruss #27 is generally considered his primary rookie card by most collectors, though he also has rookie cards in the 1985 Fleer (#647) and 1985 Topps (#362) sets. Some collectors also recognize his 1984 Cramer Salt Lake City Gulls minor league card as a "pre-rookie" card of significance.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I find the current value of my Danny Tartabull cards?" >}}
    To determine current values for your Danny Tartabull cards, you can check recent sales on platforms like eBay (completed listings), COMC.com, or card-specific price guides like Beckett or Sports Card Pro. For more accurate valuations, consider the card's condition, whether it's graded, and any special attributes (autographs, rare variations). Online sports card communities can also provide helpful price assessments based on photos of your specific cards.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Will 80s and 90s baseball cards like Tartabull's ever increase substantially in value?" >}}
    Most standard 1980s and 1990s baseball cards, including common Danny Tartabull cards, are unlikely to see substantial value increases due to massive overproduction during this era. However, specific high-grade examples, particularly PSA 10 rookie cards and truly scarce variations like Desert Shield cards, have better appreciation potential. The sports card market demonstrates that even in overproduced eras, the absolute best examples of cards can still command premium prices and show growth over time.

## Conclusion: Danny Tartabull Cards in the Modern Collecting Landscape

Danny Tartabull's baseball cards occupy an interesting niche in the sports card collecting world. While not among the most valuable players of his era, his cards—particularly high-grade rookies and rare variations like the Desert Shield—continue to attract dedicated collectors. 

For those interested in Tartabull cards, focusing on condition and authenticity is key. The most promising cards for both collectors and investors are PSA 9-10 graded rookies, Desert Shield variants, and authenticated autographs. Common issues from the mass-production era have limited value but remain affordable options for player and team collectors.

As with many players from this era, the market shows greatest respect for the truly exceptional examples rather than common cards. This pattern will likely continue, with the gap between gem mint and average condition examples growing over time.

Whether you're a longtime fan of the power-hitting outfielder, a team collector focusing on the Royals or Yankees, or simply interested in the sports card market of the 1980s and 1990s, Danny Tartabull's cards offer an accessible entry point with some genuinely collectible highlights for the discerning collector.
