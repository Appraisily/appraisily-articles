        text: >-
          Most 1964-D nickels in circulation are worth only 10 to 20
          cents—slightly above face value. However, well-preserved specimens in
          mint condition can command significantly higher prices, with
          uncirculated MS63 examples worth $2-$5, gem uncirculated MS65
          specimens worth $10-$15, and superb gem MS67 examples potentially
          worth $500-$600.

      acceptedAnswer:
        '@type': Answer
        text: >-
          The value of a 1964-D nickel depends primarily on its condition, with
          uncirculated specimens being worth more than circulated ones. Rare
          error varieties like repunched mint marks, Full Steps examples with
          complete stair details on Monticello, and Special Strike specimens can
          be worth significantly more than standard issues.

When it comes to collecting Jefferson nickels, the 1964-D holds an interesting place in American numismatic history. As the last year before the U.S. Mint transitioned from silver to copper-nickel clad coins for dimes and quarters, 1964 was a significant transitional period for American coinage. But what exactly is a 1964-D nickel worth today?

![1964-D Jefferson Nickel obverse and reverse showing the mint mark location](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1964-d-nickel-worth/how-much-is-a-1964-d-nickel-worth-image-1_aVTj97wjq.png)

Most 1964-D nickels in circulation are worth only 10 to 20 cents—slightly above face value. However, well-preserved specimens in mint condition can command significantly higher prices, with the most exceptional examples potentially worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything that affects the value of your 1964-D nickel—from mint marks and mintage figures to condition grading and rare errors that could make your coin exceptionally valuable.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1964-D Nickel Value at a Glance" level="2" >}}
Before diving into the details, here's a quick overview of what your 1964-D nickel might be worth based on its condition.

Understanding the historical context helps explain why the 1964-D nickel holds a unique place in American numismatics.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The Jefferson nickel design, created by Felix Schlag, debuted in 1938, replacing the Buffalo nickel. By 1964, the Denver Mint was producing these five-cent pieces in record numbers.

![Close-up of a 1964-D Jefferson nickel showing the mint mark on the reverse](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1964-d-nickel-worth/how-much-is-a-1964-d-nickel-worth-image-2_H284kqZkh.png)

What makes the 1964-D nickel particularly interesting is its massive mintage. The Denver Mint produced over 1.7 billion nickels in 1964—the highest production of any nickel in U.S. history up to that point. This staggering number was partly due to a nationwide coin shortage that had developed in the early 1960s.

Before determining value, it's important to properly identify your coin and understand its key features.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The 1964-D Jefferson nickel features the following characteristics:

- **Obverse**: Profile of Thomas Jefferson facing left, with "LIBERTY" and "IN GOD WE TRUST" inscriptions, and the date 1964
- **Reverse**: Monticello (Jefferson's home) with inscriptions "E PLURIBUS UNUM," "MONTICELLO," "FIVE CENTS," and "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"
- **Mint Mark**: The "D" mint mark indicating Denver Mint production appears on the reverse, to the right of Monticello
- **Composition**: 75% copper, 25% nickel
- **Weight**: 5.0 grams
- **Diameter**: 21.2 mm

### How to Find the Mint Mark

The "D" mint mark on 1964 nickels is located on the reverse side of the coin, to the right of Monticello. This indicates the coin was struck at the Denver Mint. Coins without a mint mark were produced at the Philadelphia Mint.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors Affecting 1964-D Nickel Value" level="2" >}}
Several key factors determine how much your 1964-D nickel is worth on today's collector market.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Condition and Grading

The condition of your 1964-D nickel is the most important factor in determining its value. Professional coin grading uses the Sheldon Scale, ranging from Poor (P-1) to Perfect Mint State (MS-70).

For 1964-D nickels, even the difference between MS65 (Gem Uncirculated) and MS67 (Superb Gem) can mean a price jump from around $15 to $600 or more.

  <td>Virtually flawless</td>
  <td>$500-$600</td>
</tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

### Full Steps Designation

For Jefferson nickels, a special designation called "Full Steps" (FS) can dramatically increase value. This refers to the visibility of the steps on Monticello on the reverse of the coin. Most 1964-D nickels show worn or incomplete steps due to weak strikes or circulation wear.

A Full Steps designation requires:
- Five or six complete, distinct steps visible on Monticello
- No breaks or interruptions in the step lines
- Clear definition between each step

Full Steps 1964-D nickels are extremely rare, especially in high grades:
- A 1964-D nickel with MS65FS designation can be worth $650-$750
- A 1964-D nickel with MS66FS designation can sell for $3,500-$4,500
- MS67FS examples are exceedingly rare and could command even higher prices

![Magnified view of the steps on Monticello showing full steps on a high-grade 1964-D nickel](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1964-d-nickel-worth/how-much-is-a-1964-d-nickel-worth-image-4_zHs-C8hO1.png)

### Special Strike Nickels

Some 1964 nickels (including D-mint examples) were struck as Special Mint Set coins. While the U.S. Mint didn't officially sell SMS sets in 1964, some special finish coins from that year exist and are highly prized by collectors.

The 1964 Special Strike Jefferson Nickels feature:
- Extremely sharp strikes
- Sharp, square edge rims
- Satin-like surface appearance
- Neither circulation strike nor proof finish

These Special Strike 1964-D nickels can be worth significantly more than regular issues, with prices ranging from several hundred to several thousand dollars depending on condition.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Valuable 1964-D Nickel Errors and Varieties" level="2" >}}
Error coins represent mint mistakes that escaped quality control, and these can be worth substantial premiums over regular issues.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The most valuable 1964-D nickels are those with significant minting errors. Here are some known error varieties to look for:

### 1. 1964-D/D Repunched Mint Mark

One of the most valuable 1964-D nickel errors is the repunched mint mark variety, where the "D" was stamped twice, slightly offset. This error is visible under magnification as a doubled or "shadow" D mint mark.

- In MS65 condition, a 1964-D/D nickel can be worth approximately $4,000
- This variety has sold for over $20,000 in pristine condition

### 2. Double Die Errors

Double die errors occur when the die used to strike the coin received a doubled impression. On 1964-D nickels, look for:

- Doubling on date numerals
- Doubling on lettering (especially "LIBERTY" or "IN GOD WE TRUST")
- Doubling on Jefferson's profile

Depending on the prominence of the doubling, these errors can fetch $100-$1,000 or more.

### 3. Off-Center Strikes

When a coin is not properly positioned during striking, it results in an off-center strike. The value depends on how far off-center the strike is and whether the date and mint mark are visible:

- 10% off-center: $20-$50
- 20-50% off-center with visible date and mint mark: $50-$200
- More than 50% off-center with visible date and mint mark: $200-$500

### 4. Rotated Dies

When the reverse die is not properly aligned with the obverse die, it results in a rotated die error. The value increases with the degree of rotation:

- Slight rotation (10-45 degrees): $10-$30
- Moderate rotation (45-90 degrees): $30-$75
- Severe rotation (90-180 degrees): $75-$200

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How to Sell Your 1964-D Nickel" level="2" >}}
If you believe you have a valuable 1964-D nickel, here are some options for selling it.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Professional Grading First

Before selling any potentially valuable coin, consider having it professionally graded by a reputable third-party grading service such as:

- Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS)
- Numismatic Guaranty Company (NGC)
- ANACS

Professional grading provides:
- Authentication (confirming the coin is genuine)
- Condition assessment on the standard numismatic scale
- Encapsulation in a tamper-evident holder
- Documentation of any special attributes (like Full Steps or error varieties)

While grading services charge fees (typically $20-$50 per coin plus membership fees), the increased marketability and potentially higher selling price often justifies the expense for valuable specimens.

### Selling Options

Once your coin is authenticated and graded, you have several options for selling:

1. **Coin Dealers**: Local coin shops or national dealers can offer immediate payment, though typically at wholesale prices (70-80% of retail value).

2. **Auction Houses**: For highly valuable 1964-D nickels (particularly rare errors or highest-grade examples), specialized numismatic auction houses like Heritage Auctions, Stack's Bowers, or GreatCollections may be your best option.

3. **Online Marketplaces**: eBay, Reddit's r/Coins4Sale, or specialized forums like CoinTalk allow direct sales to collectors, potentially bringing higher prices but requiring more effort.

4. **Coin Shows**: Larger coin shows attract numerous dealers and collectors, creating a competitive environment that may result in better offers.

For most circulated 1964-D nickels worth only 10-20 cents, the effort of selling individually may not be worthwhile unless you have a large quantity.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Tips for Collecting 1964-D Nickels" level="2" >}}
If you're interested in starting or expanding a collection of 1964-D Jefferson nickels, here are some helpful tips.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### What to Look For

When collecting 1964-D nickels, consider focusing on:

1. **Condition**: Even though 1964-D nickels are common, finding examples in pristine uncirculated condition can be challenging and rewarding.

2. **Full Steps**: Search for nickels with complete, well-struck steps on Monticello. These are much rarer than regular strikes.

3. **Error Varieties**: Use a magnifying glass (at least 5x) to examine mint marks for repunching, dates and inscriptions for doubling, and overall coin alignment for striking errors.

4. **Original Mint Luster**: Uncirculated coins should display the original mint frost or luster. Avoid cleaned or polished examples.

5. **Toning**: Some collectors prize nicely toned nickels that have developed attractive color patterns over decades of proper storage.

### Proper Storage

To preserve your 1964-D nickels:

- Use archival-quality coin holders, flips, or albums made of materials free from PVC or other harmful chemicals
- Store in a cool, dry environment with stable humidity
- Avoid touching coin surfaces with bare hands (use cotton gloves or hold by edges)
- Never clean coins with chemicals, abrasives, or even water
- Consider a safe deposit box for valuable specimens

{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

{{< content-modules/faq title="Frequently Asked Questions" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is a 1964-D nickel rare?" >}}
    No, the 1964-D nickel is not rare in general circulation. In fact, it has one of the highest mintages of any Jefferson nickel, with over 1.7 billion produced. This makes it a very common coin to find.

    However, certain varieties and conditions of the 1964-D nickel can be quite rare:

    - 1964-D nickels with Full Steps (all 5 or 6 steps visible on Monticello)
    - 1964-D/D repunched mint mark varieties
    - 1964-D nickels in gem uncirculated condition (MS65 or higher)
    - Special Strike 1964-D nickels with satin-like finishes
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes the 1964-D nickel rare or valuable?" >}}
    While most 1964-D nickels are common, certain factors can make individual specimens rare and valuable:

    1. **Exceptional Condition** - Coins in pristine mint state (MS67 or higher) are extremely rare and valuable.
    
    2. **Full Steps** - Nickels showing complete, uninterrupted steps on Monticello are rare due to typical weak strikes.
    
    3. **Repunched Mint Mark** - The 1964-D/D variety with a doubled mint mark can be worth thousands.
    
    4. **Special Strike** - Some 1964 nickels received special satin finishes and are highly prized.
    
    5. **Significant Errors** - Major off-center strikes, wrong planchet errors, or dramatic die breaks can command premiums.

    Despite the high mintage, finding examples with these characteristics is surprisingly difficult, making them valuable to collectors.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where can I sell my 1964-D nickel?" >}}
    You have several options for selling your 1964-D nickel, depending on its condition and value:

    1. **Local Coin Dealers** - Quick and convenient, though they typically pay wholesale prices (70-80% of retail value).
    
    2. **Online Marketplaces** - eBay, Reddit's r/Coins4Sale, or Facebook Marketplace allow direct sales to collectors.
    
    3. **Coin Shows** - Events where multiple dealers compete for purchases, potentially resulting in better offers.
    
    4. **Auction Houses** - For rare or valuable specimens, specialized numismatic auction houses like Heritage Auctions, Stack's Bowers, or GreatCollections may yield the best results.
    
    5. **Online Dealer Buying Programs** - Companies like APMEX, JM Bullion, and others have coin buying programs.

    For standard circulated 1964-D nickels worth only 10-20 cents, selling in bulk lots might be more practical than individual sales.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can you tell a 1964 special strike nickel?" >}}
    1964 Special Strike nickels have distinctive characteristics that differentiate them from regular circulation strikes:

    1. **Sharper Strike** - Extremely well-defined details, particularly on Jefferson's hair and Monticello's columns and steps.
    
    2. **Square Edge Rims** - The edges appear more squared-off and precisely defined than on circulation strikes.
    
    3. **Satin-like Surface** - A distinctive finish that's neither the frosty appearance of business strikes nor the mirror-like quality of proofs.
    
    4. **Superior Metal Flow** - Evidence of better metal flow during striking, resulting in crisper details.
    
    5. **Higher Relief** - Design elements may appear to have slightly higher relief than regular strikes.

    These Special Strike nickels weren't officially sold in sets but were specially produced. They're scarce and highly collectible, with values typically ranging from several hundred to several thousand dollars depending on condition.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What to look for on a 1964-D nickel?" >}}
    When examining a 1964-D nickel for potential value, look for these key features:

    1. **Mint Mark Position** - Check for a D mint mark to the right of Monticello. Look for possible repunching (D/D variety).
    
    2. **Monticello Steps** - Examine whether all 5 or 6 steps on Monticello are fully visible and separated. Full Steps examples are valuable.
    
    3. **Strike Quality** - Look for sharp, well-defined features on both obverse and reverse.
    
    4. **Surface Preservation** - Check for scratches, bag marks, or other damage that would lower grade.
    
    5. **Doubling** - Use magnification to look for doubled elements on the date, inscriptions, or Jefferson's profile.
    
    6. **Errors** - Look for off-center strikes, rotated dies, die cracks, or other minting mistakes.
    
    7. **Original Surfaces** - Ensure the coin hasn't been cleaned, which significantly reduces value.
    
    8. **Special Finish** - Look for the satin-like appearance that might indicate a Special Strike specimen.

    Use a good quality magnifying glass (5x to 10x) for proper examination.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a 1964-D nickel worth with no mint mark?" >}}
    This is a common misunderstanding. A 1964 nickel without a mint mark is not a 1964-D nickel. The "D" refers to the Denver mint mark.

    - A 1964-D nickel has a "D" mint mark on the reverse, to the right of Monticello.
    - A 1964 nickel with no mint mark was produced at the Philadelphia Mint.

    In 1964, the Philadelphia Mint did not place a mint mark on its nickels (the P mint mark wasn't used on nickels until 1980). So a "1964 nickel with no mint mark" is simply a Philadelphia-minted 1964 nickel.

    The value of a 1964 Philadelphia (no mint mark) nickel is similar to the 1964-D:
    - Circulated: 10-20 cents
    - MS65: $10-$15
    - MS67: $400-$500
    - MS65 Full Steps: $300-$400
    - MS66 Full Steps: $800-$1,000

    If you believe you have a 1964-D nickel but can't find the mint mark, check carefully on the reverse to the right of Monticello. If there's truly no mint mark, you have a Philadelphia Mint coin, not a 1964-D.

Final thoughts on the value and collectibility of 1964-D Jefferson nickels.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

While most 1964-D nickels found in circulation are worth only slightly more than face value (10-20 cents), there are exceptional cases where these common coins can be surprisingly valuable. The key is knowing what to look for and properly assessing condition.

For the average collector or someone who has found a 1964-D nickel in pocket change, here's what to remember:

1. **Condition is crucial** - Even common coins in exceptionally preserved condition can be worth multiples of their face value.

2. **Special varieties matter** - Look for Full Steps, repunched mint marks, and other varieties that can dramatically increase value.

3. **Professional grading helps** - For potentially valuable specimens, professional authentication and grading provides assurance to buyers and typically increases resale value.

4. **Preservation is important** - If you find a nicely preserved 1964-D nickel, store it properly to maintain its condition and potential value.

Whether your 1964-D nickel is worth 10 cents or potentially thousands of dollars, these coins represent an important piece of American numismatic history—the last year before the dramatic changes in U.S. coinage composition that would follow in 1965. For this historical significance alone, they're worth a closer look.
