          No, the 'TRVST' instead of 'TRUST' in the motto 'IN GOD WE TRUST' is
          not an error. This is the correct design, as the letter 'U' was
          stylized as a 'V' in accordance with classical Roman lettering
          conventions of the time.

## Introduction to 1922 Misprint Silver Dollars

The 1922 Peace Dollar represents a significant chapter in American numismatic history. While millions were minted, certain error varieties and misprints command substantial premiums in today's collector market. These coins were part of the Peace Dollar series introduced in 1921 to commemorate the peace following World War I. 

Among regular 1922 Peace Dollars, certain error coins stand out for their rarity and collector appeal. These "misprint" dollars (more accurately called error coins or varieties in numismatic terminology) range from striking errors to die varieties and can be worth substantially more than their standard counterparts.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Common 1922 Peace Dollar Error Types" level="2" >}}
  Several notable error types exist for the 1922 Peace Dollar, each with different levels of rarity and value. Understanding these varieties is crucial for accurate identification and valuation.

![Different types of 1922 Peace Dollar errors and varieties](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1922-misprint-silver-dollar-worth/how-much-is-a-1922-misprint-silver-dollar-worth-image-2_GMW9SWu96.png)

### The "TRVST" Error Variety

One of the most discussed "errors" in 1922 Peace Dollars isn't actually an error at all. Many novice collectors believe they've found a rare misprint when they see "TRVST" instead of "TRUST" in the motto "IN GOD WE TRUST." However, this is the correct design, as the letter "U" was stylized as a "V" in accordance with classical Roman lettering conventions of the time.

Despite not being a true error, many people search for this "TRVST" variety believing it to be valuable. The standard design uses this classical lettering on all Peace Dollars, so this feature alone doesn't add premium value.

### The 1922 "No Mint Mark" Error (1922 Plain)

A genuine and valuable error is the 1922 "No Mint Mark" Peace Dollar. While Philadelphia-minted coins typically carried no mint mark, all 1922 Peace Dollars were supposed to be minted at Denver (D) or San Francisco (S). When a Denver-minted coin appears without the "D" mint mark due to a die polishing error, it creates the rare "1922 Plain" variety.

Unlike their 1922-D counterparts that typically sell for $25-$39 in circulated condition, these No Mint Mark errors can fetch significantly higher prices:

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1922 No Mint Mark Peace Dollar Values" description="Current estimated market values" >}}
  <tr>
    <td>Fine (F-12)</td>
    <td>$400-$600</td>
    <td>Visible wear but major features intact</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>$800-$1,000</td>
    <td>Light wear, clear details remain</td>

    <td>Extremely Fine (XF-40)</td>
    <td>$1,200-$1,500</td>
    <td>Minor wear on highest points</td>

  <tr>
    <td>About Uncirculated (AU-50)</td>
    <td>$2,500-$3,000</td>
    <td>Slight traces of wear, nearly full luster</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mint State (MS-60 to MS-63)</td>
    <td>$4,500-$7,000</td>
    <td>No wear, may have contact marks</td>
  </tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

### The "Moustache" VAM-12A Variety

The VAM-12A "Moustache" variety is a fascinating die error where a curved die gouge appears between Liberty's nose and mouth, creating what looks like a moustache on Lady Liberty's face.

{{< visual-modules/hero-image src="https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1922-misprint-silver-dollar-worth/how-much-is-a-1922-misprint-silver-dollar-worth-image-3_wgHJnpPeU.png" alt="1922 Peace Dollar 'Moustache' VAM-12A variety showing the distinctive die error" caption="The 'Moustache' VAM-12A variety showing the distinctive curved die gouge resembling a moustache" />}}

According to [Find Bullion Prices](https://findbullionprices.com/blog/1922-silver-dollar-value-errors-rare-mint-marks-and-peace-dollar-varieties-worth-money/), these "Moustache" varieties typically sell for:

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="'Moustache' VAM-12A Variety Values" columns="3" / /  >}}

- Fine (F) condition: $100 to $150
- Extra Fine (XF45) condition: $250 to $400
- Mint State: $500+

### Double Struck Errors

Double struck errors occur when a coin fails to eject properly after the first strike and receives a second impression from the dies. The 1922 Peace Dollar double struck errors are rare and highly sought after by collectors.

One notable example is a 1922 Peace Silver Dollar that was [double struck in collar with the second strike rotated 90 degrees](https://auctions.stacksbowers.com/lots/view/3-AB7GM/1922-peace-silver-dollar-double-struck-in-collar-second-strike-rotated-90-degrees-ms-64-pcgs-gold-shield-holder). These dramatic errors can sell for several thousand dollars, especially in higher grades.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1922 High Relief Peace Dollar" level="2" >}}
  While not technically a misprint, the 1922 High Relief variety represents an important transitional design that commands significant premiums.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The original 1921 Peace Dollar design featured a high relief that proved difficult for production. In early 1922, before switching to the standard lower relief design, the Philadelphia Mint produced a small number of 1922 Peace Dollars in high relief.

According to the [US Gold Bureau](https://www.usgoldbureau.com/news/post/1922-silver-dollar-value-what-is-it-worth-today), these high relief coins were struck fewer times before the mint shifted to a lower relief design for easier production. Most of the 35,401 high relief coins produced were later melted, making genuine survivors exceptionally rare.

[USA Coin Book](https://www.usacoinbook.com/coins/3305/dollars/peace/1922-P/high-relief/) estimates the value of a 1922 High Relief Peace Dollar in proof condition at over $300,000.

Even more rare is a unique coin with the 1922 high-relief obverse paired with a 1921 reverse. Only one example of this transitional piece is known to exist.

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1922 High Relief Peace Dollar Values" description="Market values by grade" >}}
  <tr>
    <td>AU-50 (About Uncirculated)</td>
    <td>$25,000-$35,000</td>
    <td>Slight wear on highest points</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MS-60 (Mint State)</td>
    <td>$40,000-$60,000</td>
    <td>No wear but may have numerous marks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MS-63 (Choice Uncirculated)</td>
    <td>$80,000-$120,000</td>
    <td>Few scattered marks, good eye appeal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MS-65 (Gem Uncirculated)</td>
    <td>$150,000-$200,000</td>
    <td>Very few marks, exceptional eye appeal</td>

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Understanding Regular 1922 Peace Dollar Values" level="2" >}}
  Before focusing solely on errors, it's important to understand the baseline value of standard 1922 Peace Dollars.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Standard 1922 Peace Silver Dollar with mint mark location highlighted](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1922-misprint-silver-dollar-worth/how-much-is-a-1922-misprint-silver-dollar-worth-image-4_P_9ISeFrA.png)

The 1922 was the first full year of Peace Dollar production, with over 84 million coins minted across three facilities:

- Philadelphia (no mint mark): 51,737,000 minted
- Denver (D mint mark): 15,063,000 minted
- San Francisco (S mint mark): 17,475,000 minted

Due to this high mintage, standard 1922 Peace Dollars are among the most common in the series. According to [Hero Bullion](https://www.herobullion.com/1922-peace-dollar-value/), most 1922 Peace Dollars in average circulated condition are worth between $25 and $39, essentially their silver melt value with a small numismatic premium.

Values increase significantly for coins in higher grades:

{{< visual-modules/timeline title="1922 Peace Dollar Value Progression" >}}
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="Good to Very Good" title="$25-$30" >}}
    Heavy wear with major details visible

  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="Extremely Fine" title="$36-$45" >}}
    Light wear primarily on high points
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="About Uncirculated" title="$45-$60" >}}
    Very slight wear, nearly full luster
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="Mint State (MS-60 to MS-63)" title="$60-$100" >}}
    No wear, varying degrees of contact marks
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="Gem Mint State (MS-65+)" title="$150-$7,000+" >}}
    Premium examples with exceptional eye appeal
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
{{< /visual-modules/timeline >}}

The highest values are for coins in gem mint state condition. According to [Hero Bullion](https://www.herobullion.com/1922-peace-dollar-value/), a 1922 Peace Dollar (no mint mark) graded MS-67 sold for $7,000, while a 1922-D in MS-67+ condition achieved $36,000 at auction.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How to Identify Authentic 1922 Error Dollars" level="2" >}}
  Authentication is crucial when dealing with potentially valuable error coins. Here are key factors to examine.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Close-up of 1922 Peace Dollar showing authentication points](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1922-misprint-silver-dollar-worth/how-much-is-a-1922-misprint-silver-dollar-worth-image-5_SsXzByELp.png)

### Authenticating the 1922 No Mint Mark Error

The genuine 1922 No Mint Mark Peace Dollar resulted from excessive die polishing at the Denver Mint. To authenticate this variety:

1. Confirm the absence of a mint mark where the "D" should appear (below "ONE" on the reverse)
2. Look for weakened details on the reverse, particularly on "ONE DOLLAR" and eagle's feathers
3. Check for die characteristics that match known authentic examples

Be cautious of artificially removed mint marks, where someone has tampered with a 1922-D to make it appear as the valuable No Mint Mark variety.

  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Silver ring test produces correct tone" /  >}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### Authenticating the "Moustache" VAM-12A Variety

The VAM-12A "Moustache" variety shows a distinctive curved die gouge between Liberty's nose and mouth. This error is more noticeable on coins with minimal wear and is often found only on early strikes before the die was replaced or repaired.

To authenticate:

1. Use a magnifying glass to examine the area between Liberty's nose and mouth
2. Look for the curved die gouge that resembles a moustache
3. Compare to known authenticated examples
4. Consider professional authentication for high-value specimens

### Professional Authentication

For potentially valuable error coins, professional authentication is highly recommended. Organizations like PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) and NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation) provide expert verification and grading services that:

1. Confirm authenticity
2. Verify the specific error variety
3. Establish condition grade
4. Protect the coin in a tamper-evident holder
5. Provide documentation that enhances resale value

  If you've identified a valuable 1922 error dollar, here are the best avenues for selling.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Auction Houses

For rare, high-value errors like the 1922 High Relief or authenticated 1922 No Mint Mark dollars, specialized numismatic auction houses often achieve the highest prices:

- Heritage Auctions
- Stack's Bowers
- Great Collections

These auction houses have expert numismatists who can properly catalog your coin and market it to serious collectors.

### Coin Dealers

Established coin dealers can offer immediate payment, though typically at wholesale prices:

- Local coin shops (convenient but may offer lower prices)
- National dealers (may offer better prices for rare varieties)
- Dealers at major coin shows (can generate competitive offers)

### Online Marketplaces

Online platforms can connect you directly with collectors:

- eBay (largest audience but higher fees and risk)
- [Heritage Auctions online](https://coins.ha.com/) (lower fees for coins than general auction platforms)
- Specialized numismatic forums and marketplaces

For error coins valued over $1,000, professional certification is strongly recommended before listing online to enhance buyer confidence and achieve maximum value.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is the 'TRVST' on my 1922 Peace Dollar an error?" >}}
    No, this is not an error. All Peace Dollars have "IN GOD WE TRVST" with a V instead of a U. This classical Roman-style lettering was intentional in the design by Anthony de Francisci and appears on all Peace Dollars from 1921-1935. It doesn't add any premium value to your coin.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if I have the rare 1922 No Mint Mark error?" >}}
    The genuine 1922 No Mint Mark error was caused by excessive die polishing at the Denver Mint. Look for these characteristics:
    
    - Complete absence of a mint mark (should be located below "ONE" on the reverse)
    - Weakened design elements on the reverse, especially on "ONE DOLLAR" and the eagle's feathers
    - No signs of tampering around where the mint mark should be
    
    This is a rare variety, so professional authentication is recommended.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the 1922 'Moustache' VAM-12A variety worth?" >}}
    The 1922 "Moustache" VAM-12A variety shows a distinctive curved die gouge between Liberty's nose and mouth. Values typically range from:
    
    - $100-$150 in Fine condition
    - $250-$400 in Extra Fine (XF45) condition
    - $500+ in Mint State condition
    
    The error is more noticeable on coins with minimal wear and is often found only on early strikes.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a regular 1922 Peace Dollar worth?" >}}
    Standard 1922 Peace Dollars without errors typically sell for:
    
    - $25-$35 in circulated condition (roughly their silver melt value plus a small premium)
    - $40-$60 in About Uncirculated condition
    - $60-$100 in lower Mint State grades (MS-60 to MS-63)
    - $150-$300+ in higher Mint State grades (MS-64 to MS-65)
    - $1,000+ for superb gem examples (MS-66 and above)
    
    Mint mark can affect value, with Philadelphia (no mint mark) and Denver (D) being more common than San Francisco (S).
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes the 1922 High Relief Peace Dollar so valuable?" >}}
    The 1922 High Relief Peace Dollar is rare because:
    
    1. It was a transitional design produced in limited quantities (35,401 coins)
    2. Most were melted after production
    3. It features higher relief details similar to the 1921 design before the mint switched to the standard lower relief
    
    Authenticated examples can sell for $25,000+ in About Uncirculated condition and $300,000+ in Proof condition. Only one example with a 1922 high-relief obverse and 1921 reverse is known to exist.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where can I sell my 1922 error Peace Dollar?" >}}
    The best venues for selling valuable 1922 error dollars include:
    
    - Specialized numismatic auction houses (Heritage Auctions, Stack's Bowers)
    - Established coin dealers (local or national)
    - Online marketplaces (eBay, specialized numismatic forums)
    
    For valuable errors, professional certification from PCGS or NGC is highly recommended before selling to authenticate the error and establish condition.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my 1922 Peace Dollar is silver?" >}}
    All genuine 1922 Peace Dollars are 90% silver and 10% copper. To verify silver content:
    
    1. Check the weight (should be approximately 26.73 grams)
    2. Measure the diameter (should be 38.1mm)
    3. Perform a magnet test (silver is not magnetic)
    4. Listen to the ring test (silver coins produce a distinctive high-pitched ring)
    5. Look for any signs of copper showing through heavily worn areas
    
    Counterfeit silver dollars might be made of base metals plated with silver, and usually have incorrect weight, poor strike details, or wrong ring sound.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What other valuable errors exist for 1922 Peace Dollars?" >}}
    Beyond the No Mint Mark and "Moustache" varieties, other valuable 1922 Peace Dollar errors include:
    
    - Double struck errors (coins struck twice by the dies)
    - Off-center strikes (design not centered on the planchet)
    - Broadstrike errors (struck outside the collar die)
    - Die cracks and cuds (raised lines or lumps caused by damaged dies)
    - Lamination errors (flaws in the metal that cause portions to split or peel)
    
    These mechanical errors are typically rarer than die varieties and can command significant premiums based on the visual appeal and severity of the error.
