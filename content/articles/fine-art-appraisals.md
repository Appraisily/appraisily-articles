## Introduction to Fine Art Appraisals

![Professional art appraiser examining a painting in a gallery setting](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/fine-art-appraisals/fine-art-appraisals-image-1_bVly15-67.png)

Whether you've inherited a family heirloom, purchased artwork as an investment, or need to document your collection for insurance purposes, understanding the value of your fine art is essential. Professional fine art appraisals provide an objective analysis of an artwork's monetary worth based on market research, expertise, and established valuation methodologies.

Unlike casual estimates or online valuations, a formal fine art appraisal delivers a thoroughly researched, legally defensible document that can be used for insurance, estate planning, charitable donations, or sales negotiations. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about obtaining and understanding professional fine art appraisals.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="What is a Fine Art Appraisal?" level="2" >}}
A fine art appraisal is a professional assessment of an artwork's monetary value conducted by a qualified appraiser who follows established methodologies and ethical standards. The resulting document provides an objective, well-researched opinion of value for a specific purpose at a specific time.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

A proper fine art appraisal differs significantly from informal valuations, auction estimates, or price checks. Professional appraisers undergo extensive training and often hold credentials from recognized appraisal organizations. They employ systematic research methods, analyze market data, and consider numerous factors specific to the artwork in question.

The appraisal document typically includes:
- Detailed description of the artwork
- Provenance (ownership history)
- Condition report
- Comparable sales analysis
- Statement of the appraised value
- Purpose of the appraisal
- Effective date of valuation
- Appraiser's qualifications

This information creates a comprehensive record that can withstand scrutiny from insurance companies, tax authorities, legal entities, and potential buyers.

## Types of Fine Art Appraisals

![Different types of art being appraised, including paintings, sculpture, and prints](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/fine-art-appraisals/fine-art-appraisals-image-2_NolhKTvdp.png)

Appraisals serve different purposes, and the intended use significantly impacts how the appraiser approaches the valuation. Each type follows different methodologies and may result in different values for the same artwork.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Insurance Appraisals" level="3" >}}
Insurance appraisals determine replacement value – the cost to replace the artwork with one of similar quality, age, and condition in the retail market if the original were damaged or stolen.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Insurance appraisals typically yield the highest valuation because they consider retail replacement costs, which include gallery mark-ups and the time and expense of finding a suitable replacement. These appraisals require regular updates (typically every 3-5 years) to reflect current market conditions and are essential for proper coverage of valuable artworks.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Fair Market Value Appraisals" level="3" >}}
Fair Market Value (FMV) represents the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and seller, with neither being under compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

FMV appraisals are primarily used for:
- Charitable donations (IRS requires qualified appraisals for donations exceeding $5,000)
- Estate tax purposes
- Estate division among heirs
- Gift tax scenarios

These appraisals typically reflect wholesale rather than retail values and must meet specific IRS requirements when used for tax purposes, including adherence to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP).

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Liquidation Value Appraisals" level="3" >}}
Liquidation value represents the price realized in a situation where the seller must dispose of the artwork within a limited time frame, often resulting in substantially lower values than FMV or replacement value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

These appraisals are used when artworks need to be sold quickly, such as in bankruptcy proceedings, estate liquidations, or forced sales. The compressed timeline typically results in the lowest valuation among appraisal types.

## The Appraisal Process Explained

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How Fine Art Appraisers Determine Value" level="2" >}}
Professional art appraisers employ a systematic methodology that combines market research, expertise in art history, and analysis of the specific artwork's characteristics to determine its monetary value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Art appraiser using digital tools to research comparable artwork sales](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/fine-art-appraisals/fine-art-appraisals-image-3_S_lnwAOyY.png)

The appraisal process typically follows these steps:

### 1. Initial Examination

The appraiser begins with a thorough examination of the artwork, noting:
- Medium and technique
- Dimensions
- Signature or identifying marks
- Date of creation
- Subject matter
- Physical condition

This initial assessment establishes the basic facts about the artwork that will guide further research.

### 2. Authentication Verification

For works of significant value, authentication may be required to confirm the artwork's legitimacy. Appraisers may:
- Examine provenance documents
- Consult artist catalogues raisonné
- Recommend scientific testing (when appropriate)
- Consult authentication boards or artist foundations

As noted by [The Fine Arts Conservancy](http://www.art-conservation.org/?page_id=1730), proper authentication is essential for establishing accurate value, particularly for works by well-known artists.

### 3. Market Research and Comparable Sales Analysis

According to the [David Barnett Gallery](https://davidbarnettgallery.com/how-does-fine-art-appraisal-work), appraisers research:
- Auction records for similar works
- Private sales data where available
- Gallery prices for comparable works
- Current market trends for the artist or genre

This research forms the backbone of the valuation, providing empirical evidence of the market's willingness to pay for similar artworks.

### 4. Valuation Calculation

With all information gathered, the appraiser calculates the value based on:
- Sales of comparable works (adjusting for differences)
- The artwork's condition relative to comparable works
- Provenance and exhibition history
- Current market conditions for the artist
- The specific purpose of the appraisal (insurance, fair market, etc.)

### 5. Report Preparation

The final step is preparing a comprehensive appraisal report that includes:
- Detailed description and images of the artwork
- Authentication information
- Provenance details
- Comparable sales analysis
- Statement of value with effective date
- Appraiser's qualifications and certification

## When To Get Your Artwork Appraised

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Important Situations Requiring Art Appraisals" level="2" >}}
Certain life events and financial situations necessitate professional fine art appraisals to protect your interests and comply with legal requirements.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Person examining a painting and considering art appraisal services](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/fine-art-appraisals/fine-art-appraisals-image-4_nCdFOcqt6.png)

### Insurance Coverage

According to [Risk Strategies](https://www.risk-strategies.com/blog/tips-for-obtaining-a-fine-art-collection-appraisal-debunking-appraisal-myths), proper insurance coverage requires accurate valuations. You should get appraisals:

- When acquiring valuable artwork
- Every 3-5 years to update values for existing collection
- After significant market shifts affecting an artist's values
- Following conservation or restoration work

Most insurance companies require professional appraisals for any artwork valued over a certain threshold (typically $5,000-$10,000) to ensure proper coverage.

### Estate Planning and Inheritance

Art appraisals are crucial during estate planning and after inheritance:

- For equitable division among heirs
- To establish proper values for estate tax purposes
- When creating trusts that include artwork
- After inheriting artwork to establish a new cost basis

The IRS closely scrutinizes artwork valuations in estates, making professional appraisals essential for compliance and avoiding penalties.

### Charitable Donations

As noted on the [IRS Art Appraisal Services](https://www.irs.gov/appeals/art-appraisal-services) page, donations of artwork valued at $5,000 or more require a qualified appraisal by a qualified appraiser for tax deduction claims. The appraisal must:

- Be conducted no earlier than 60 days before the donation
- Be received before the due date for the tax return
- Meet specific IRS requirements for format and content
- Be prepared by an appraiser with demonstrated qualifications

For artworks valued at $20,000 or more, a complete copy of the appraisal must be submitted with the tax return, and donations valued at $50,000+ may be referred to the IRS Art Appraisal Services for review by the Commissioner's Art Advisory Panel.

### Divorce Proceedings

During divorce, art appraisals help:
- Establish fair values for equitable distribution
- Determine appropriate buyout amounts if one spouse keeps the collection
- Support negotiations regarding division of assets

Courts typically require neutral, professional appraisals to ensure fairness in asset division.

### Sale or Purchase Decisions

Before selling or purchasing significant artwork, appraisals provide:
- Independent verification of fair asking prices
- Negotiation leverage with dealers or auction houses
- Documentation of investment value
- Protection against overpaying or underselling

{{< visual-modules/timeline title="When to Update Your Art Appraisals" >}}
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="Every 3-5 Years" title="Regular Updates" >}}
    Market values fluctuate regularly. Insurance companies recommend updating appraisals every 3-5 years to maintain proper coverage.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="After Major Life Events" title="Life Transitions" >}}
    Marriage, divorce, relocation, retirement, or estate planning all warrant fresh appraisals to establish current values.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="Market Shifts" title="Art Market Changes" >}}
    Major changes in an artist's market value, such as after death, retrospective exhibitions, or record-breaking sales necessitate updated appraisals.

## Choosing a Qualified Art Appraiser

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Finding the Right Professional for Your Appraisal Needs" level="2" >}}
The qualifications and expertise of your appraiser significantly impact the accuracy and credibility of your art appraisal. Selecting the right professional is crucial for ensuring your appraisal will be accepted by insurance companies, the IRS, courts, and other stakeholders.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Professional art appraiser examining artwork details with specialized tools](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/fine-art-appraisals/fine-art-appraisals-image-5_lk_cmgVEo.png)

### Professional Credentials to Look For

When selecting an appraiser, verify their professional credentials and memberships in recognized appraisal organizations such as:

- **American Society of Appraisers (ASA)** - Requires rigorous testing, education, and peer review
- **International Society of Appraisers (ISA)** - Offers specialized fine art certification
- **Appraisers Association of America (AAA)** - Focuses specifically on art and antiques

These organizations require members to:
- Complete extensive education in appraisal methodology
- Pass examinations demonstrating competence
- Follow the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP)
- Maintain continuing education requirements
- Adhere to a strict code of ethics

### Specialization and Expertise

Fine art encompasses numerous mediums, periods, and geographical regions. According to [Amanda Winstead Fine Art Appraiser](https://amandawinstead.com/), specialists with focused expertise can provide more accurate valuations in their areas of specialization.

Consider appraisers with specific knowledge in:
- The medium of your artwork (paintings, sculpture, prints, etc.)
- The time period or movement (Renaissance, Impressionism, Contemporary, etc.)
- Geographic region or cultural origin (European, Asian, African, etc.)
- Specific artists or schools relevant to your collection

### Questions to Ask Potential Appraisers

Before hiring an appraiser, conduct an interview to assess their qualifications:

1. What professional credentials do you hold?
2. Are you USPAP compliant with current certification?
3. What is your specific expertise in the type of art I own?
4. How many years have you been practicing as an appraiser?
5. What resources do you use for market research?
6. Can you provide references from clients with similar appraisal needs?
7. Will you disclose any conflicts of interest?
8. What is your fee structure and timeframe for completing the appraisal?

### Red Flags to Avoid

Be wary of appraisers who:
- Offer to purchase items they are appraising (conflict of interest)
- Base fees on a percentage of the appraised value (ethical violation)
- Cannot provide proof of credentials or USPAP compliance
- Make guarantees about specific values before examining the art
- Lack specific experience with your type of artwork
- Cannot provide sample reports or references

### Local vs. National Appraisers

For valuable or specialized collections, consider whether a local appraiser has sufficient expertise or if you should engage a national specialist:

- **Local Appraisers**: More convenient for physical examination, may have knowledge of regional artists, typically less expensive
- **National Specialists**: May have deeper expertise in specific artists or periods, greater access to comparative sales data, higher fees but potentially more accurate for high-value items

## Understanding Appraisal Costs

{{< content-modules/section-header title="What to Expect: Appraisal Fees and Timeframes" level="2" >}}
Professional fine art appraisals represent a significant investment, but the cost should be viewed in relation to the artwork's value and the protection an accurate appraisal provides. Understanding fee structures helps set appropriate expectations and budget accordingly.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Common Fee Structures

According to [Risk Strategies](https://www.risk-strategies.com/blog/tips-for-obtaining-a-fine-art-collection-appraisal-debunking-appraisal-myths), appraisal fees are typically calculated in one of these ways:

1. **Hourly Rate**: Most common approach, ranging from $125 to $350 per hour depending on the appraiser's expertise and location. Most appraisers can evaluate 5-10 items per hour, depending on complexity.

2. **Flat Fee**: Sometimes negotiable for entire collections or single high-value items, providing cost certainty.

3. **Per Item**: Less common but occasionally used for collections with items of similar complexity, typically $50-$300 per artwork depending on research requirements.

4. **Minimum Charges**: Many appraisers set minimum fees ($500-$1,000) regardless of collection size to cover basic costs and report preparation.

Important note: Ethical appraisers never charge based on a percentage of the appraised value, as this creates an inherent conflict of interest.

### Additional Cost Factors

Several factors can increase appraisal costs:

- **Report Complexity**: Detailed reports for IRS or legal purposes require more documentation and cost more than basic insurance appraisals.

- **Research Difficulty**: Obscure artists or works lacking clear provenance require more extensive research and higher fees.

- **Travel Expenses**: If the appraiser must travel to your location, travel time and expenses are typically added to the bill.

- **Rush Fees**: Expedited appraisals often incur premium charges of 25-50% above standard rates.

- **Specialized Expertise**: Rare or highly specialized items may require consultation with additional experts at extra cost.

### Cost-Saving Tips

To maximize value and potentially reduce appraisal costs:

1. Prepare documentation in advance (provenance, purchase receipts, exhibition history)
2. Group similar items from the same artist or period together
3. Consider scheduling when multiple items need appraisal rather than one at a time
4. Ask if the appraiser offers reduced rates for educational or non-profit organizations
5. Inquire about digital appraisals for lower-value items when appropriate

### Timeframe Expectations

Most appraisals follow this general timeline:

- **Initial Examination**: 1-2 hours on-site for a typical collection
- **Research Phase**: 1-2 weeks for standard appraisals, longer for complex items
- **Report Preparation**: 1-2 weeks after research completion
- **Total Time**: 2-4 weeks for standard appraisals, 4-8 weeks for complex or IRS-qualified appraisals

## Online vs. In-Person Art Appraisals

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Comparing Digital and Traditional Appraisal Options" level="2" >}}
Technology has expanded appraisal options, with online services offering convenience and often lower costs. Understanding the differences between online and in-person appraisals helps determine which approach best fits your needs and circumstances.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Online Art Appraisal Services

Services like [MutualArt](https://www.mutualart.com/art-appraisal) offer online appraisals with quick turnaround times, often within 72 hours, starting from as little as $36. These digital options provide:

**Advantages:**
- Lower cost than traditional appraisals
- Convenience of submitting photos from home
- Faster turnaround times
- Good for initial ballpark valuations
- Accessible for remote locations

**Limitations:**
- Cannot assess physical condition with the same accuracy
- May miss details visible only in person
- Often not accepted for formal purposes (IRS, legal proceedings)
- Limited ability to authenticate works
- Typically lack the comprehensive research of traditional appraisals

### Traditional In-Person Appraisals

In-person appraisals conducted by qualified professionals like those at [Louisiana Art](https://www.louisianaart.com/appraisal) or [The Fine Art Group](https://www.fineartgroup.com/services/appraisals/) provide:

**Advantages:**
- Thorough physical examination of the artwork
- Ability to detect condition issues not visible in photographs
- More comprehensive authentication assessment
- Legally defensible documentation
- Accepted by insurance companies, IRS, and courts
- More detailed comparative analysis

**Limitations:**
- Higher cost
- Requires scheduling and possibly transportation
- Longer timeframe to completion
- May require shipping artwork to specialists for certain items

### Hybrid Options

Some appraisers now offer hybrid services:
- Initial screening via digital submission
- Video consultation for preliminary assessment
- In-person follow-up only for items requiring physical inspection
- Digital reports with option for formal documentation if needed

### When to Choose Each Option

**Choose online appraisals when:**
- You need a quick estimate for curiosity or initial planning
- The item has relatively low value
- You're in a remote location without access to specialists
- You're doing preliminary research before a more formal appraisal
- Budget constraints are significant

**Choose in-person appraisals when:**
- The artwork has significant value (generally over $5,000)
- You need the appraisal for insurance, tax, or legal purposes
- Authentication questions exist
- Condition issues might impact value
- Provenance or attribution requires expert verification

For valuable collections, the [Heritage Auctions free appraisal service](https://fineart.ha.com/free-appraisals.s) can provide initial auction estimates, though these differ from formal appraisals and serve primarily as pre-auction evaluations.

## Common Art Appraisal Myths and Misconceptions

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Separating Fact from Fiction in Art Valuation" level="2" >}}
Numerous misconceptions surround the art appraisal process. Understanding the realities helps collectors make informed decisions about their artwork's valuation and avoid potential pitfalls.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Myth 1: All Appraisals Are the Same

**Fiction:** Any appraisal will work for all purposes.

**Fact:** Different appraisal types (insurance replacement value, fair market value, liquidation value) serve specific purposes and follow different methodologies. According to [Sparks Gallery](https://sparksgallery.com/learn/art-appraisal), using the wrong type for your needs can lead to significant problems, especially with insurance claims or tax filings.

### Myth 2: Gallery Valuations Are Equivalent to Appraisals

**Fiction:** The price tag in a gallery represents the artwork's appraised value.

**Fact:** Gallery retail prices include significant mark-ups and represent asking prices, not independently verified market values. They cannot be used for insurance or tax purposes and don't constitute formal appraisals.

### Myth 3: Appraisals Guarantee Future Value

**Fiction:** An appraisal predicts how much an artwork will be worth in the future.

**Fact:** Appraisals represent value opinions at a specific moment in time based on current market conditions. No appraiser can guarantee future values, which is why appraisals need periodic updates as markets change.

### Myth 4: Appraisals and Authentications Are the Same

**Fiction:** An appraisal automatically authenticates an artwork as genuine.

**Fact:** While appraisers may note authentication concerns, formal authentication often requires different expertise and may involve scientific testing, artist foundations, or authentication boards. Authentication and appraisal are related but separate processes.

### Myth 5: Online Research Can Replace Professional Appraisals

**Fiction:** You can determine accurate values through online research and price databases.

**Fact:** While online resources provide useful reference points, professional appraisers have access to private sale records, specialized databases, and the expertise to make appropriate comparisons and adjustments. DIY valuations typically lack the comprehensiveness required for formal purposes.

### Myth 6: Appraisals Are Prohibitively Expensive

**Fiction:** Professional appraisals are too costly to be worthwhile.

**Fact:** According to [Risk Strategies](https://www.risk-strategies.com/blog/tips-for-obtaining-a-fine-art-collection-appraisal-debunking-appraisal-myths), most appraisers charge $125-$350 per hour and can evaluate multiple pieces within that time. The cost should be viewed relative to the artwork's value and the protection an accurate appraisal provides. For valuable collections, the expense represents a small percentage of the total value.

### Myth 7: All Appraisers Are Equally Qualified

**Fiction:** Anyone calling themselves an art appraiser has the necessary qualifications.

**Fact:** Professional appraisers should hold credentials from recognized organizations (ASA, ISA, AAA), maintain USPAP compliance, and ideally specialize in your type of artwork. Credentials matter significantly for appraisals that will face scrutiny from insurance companies, the IRS, or courts.

## Preparing for Your Art Appraisal

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Maximizing Value and Efficiency in the Appraisal Process" level="2" >}}
Proper preparation before an appraisal appointment saves time, potentially reduces costs, and helps ensure the most accurate valuation of your artwork. Taking proactive steps creates a smoother process and more comprehensive results.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Documentation to Gather

Assemble these documents before your appraisal:

1. **Provenance Records**: Previous bills of sale, gallery receipts, certificates of authenticity, and documentation of previous owners.

2. **Exhibition History**: Records of museums or galleries where the artwork has been displayed, including exhibition catalogs or documentation.

3. **Previous Appraisals**: Any earlier valuations, even if outdated, provide useful historical context.

4. **Conservation Records**: Documentation of any restoration, cleaning, or conservation treatments performed.

5. **Artist Information**: Articles, books, or catalog raisonnés featuring the artist or the specific artwork.

6. **Insurance Records**: Previous insurance riders or schedules listing the artwork.

7. **Photographs**: Historical photos showing the artwork's condition over time, if available.

### Preparing Your Artwork

Physical preparation is equally important:

1. **Accessibility**: Ensure the appraiser can easily access all parts of the artwork, including backs of paintings and bottoms of sculptures.

2. **Lighting**: Arrange for good lighting so the appraiser can properly examine details and condition.

3. **Removal from Walls**: For larger collections, discuss with the appraiser whether items should be removed from walls in advance.

4. **Clean Gently**: Remove surface dust with appropriate methods, but avoid any cleaning that might affect the artwork's condition.

5. **Frames**: If original frames are stored separately, have them available for inspection.

### Questions to Prepare

Prepare a list of questions for your appraiser:

1. What factors most significantly affect this artwork's value?
2. How does the condition impact the valuation?
3. What is the appropriate insurance coverage based on the appraisal?
4. How often should this particular work be reappraised?
5. Are there conservation concerns that should be addressed?
6. What documentation should I maintain to support the artwork's value?
7. How might the market for this artist/style evolve in coming years?

### After the Appraisal

Once you receive your appraisal:

1. **Review Thoroughly**: Check for any factual errors about the artwork.
2. **Request Clarification**: If any aspects of the valuation methodology are unclear, ask for explanation.
3. **Secure Digital Copies**: Store digital versions in multiple secure locations.
4. **Update Insurance**: Provide the appraisal to your insurance company to update coverage.
5. **Schedule Future Updates**: Note when the appraisal should be reviewed (typically 3-5 years).
6. **Store Properly**: Keep physical copies in fireproof storage along with other important documents.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are art appraisals worth it?" >}}
    Yes, professional art appraisals are worth the investment for several important reasons:
    
    - **Insurance Protection**: Ensures proper coverage in case of damage, theft, or loss
    
    - **Tax Compliance**: Required by the IRS for donations over $5,000 and estate valuations
    
    - **Financial Planning**: Provides accurate information for estate planning and wealth management
    
    - **Dispute Prevention**: Helps avoid conflicts during estate divisions or divorces
    
    - **Investment Knowledge**: Offers insight into your collection's current market value
    
    - **Authentication Concerns**: May identify potential issues with authenticity
    
    The cost of an appraisal is typically a small percentage of the artwork's value and provides essential documentation that protects your investment and ensures compliance with legal and insurance requirements.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How often should artwork be appraised?" >}}
    The general recommendation is to update art appraisals every 3-5 years, but certain situations warrant more frequent valuations:
    
    - After significant market changes affecting the artist's values
    - Following major museum exhibitions featuring the artist
    - After the artist's death, which often impacts market values
    - When the artist receives significant critical recognition or awards
    - Following restoration or conservation work
    - Before and after lending artwork to exhibitions
    - When planning to sell or donate the artwork
    - For insurance policy renewals (as required by the insurer)
    
    Regular updates ensure your insurance coverage remains adequate and that you have current values for financial planning purposes.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Can I get a free art appraisal?" >}}
    While true professional appraisals are rarely free, several options exist for preliminary valuations at no cost:
    
    - **Auction Houses**: Major auction houses like Heritage Auctions offer free evaluations for items they might accept for consignment
    
    - **Gallery Evaluations**: Galleries may provide informal valuations for works by artists they represent
    
    - **Museum Curators**: Some museums offer identification days where curators provide informal opinions (not formal appraisals)
    
    - **Online Forums**: Some online communities provide general guidance, though reliability varies greatly
    
    - **Appraisal Events**: PBS's Antiques Roadshow and similar local events offer free evaluations
    
    Remember that these free services typically provide estimates rather than formal appraisals. For insurance, tax, or legal purposes, you'll need a professional appraisal from a qualified appraiser.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What's the difference between an appraisal and an authentication?" >}}
    Appraisals and authentications are distinct but related processes:
    
    **Art Appraisal**:
    - Determines the monetary value of an artwork
    - Considers market factors, condition, provenance, and comparables
    - Results in a documented opinion of value for specific purposes
    - Conducted by qualified appraisers with market expertise
    
    **Authentication**:
    - Determines whether an artwork is genuinely created by the attributed artist
    - Focuses on technical analysis, stylistic examination, and provenance research
    - Results in a judgment about the work's legitimacy
    - Conducted by scholars, artist foundations, authentication boards, or scientific labs
    
    While appraisers may note authentication concerns, formal authentication often requires specialized expertise beyond appraisal qualifications. An authentic work must be authenticated before it can be properly appraised, as authenticity fundamentally affects value.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What documents do I need for an IRS-qualified art appraisal?" >}}
    For an IRS-qualified appraisal (for donations or estate tax purposes), you'll need:
    
    1. **Qualified Appraisal Document** that includes:
       - Description of the artwork
       - Physical condition assessment
       - Date (or expected date) of contribution
       - Terms of any agreements about the artwork's use or disposition
       - Appraiser's qualifications, including certification
       - Statement that the appraisal was prepared for income tax purposes
    
    2. **IRS Form 8283** (Noncash Charitable Contributions) signed by both the appraiser and the receiving organization
    
    3. **Proof of Acquisition** showing how and when you acquired the artwork
    
    4. **Provenance Documentation** establishing the artwork's history
    
    5. **Photographs** of the donated artwork
    
    For artwork valued over $20,000, a complete copy of the appraisal must be submitted with your tax return. For items over $50,000, the IRS Art Appraisal Services may review the valuation.
    
    The appraisal must be conducted no earlier than 60 days before the donation date and no later than the due date for the tax return.
