          The value of a 1927 Buffalo Nickel can range from a few dollars to
          hundreds or even thousands, depending on the mint mark, condition
          grade, and presence of rare error varieties. Common circulated
          specimens may be worth $2-$10, while uncirculated examples or those
          with mint marks can be worth significantly more.

        text: >-
          The Buffalo Nickel, also known as the Indian Head Nickel, was designed
          by James Earle Fraser and minted from 1913 to 1938. It features a
          Native American chief on the obverse (combining features from three
          chiefs: Iron Tail, Two Moons, and John Big Tree) and an American bison
          on the reverse, based on Black Diamond. The design represented a
          departure from European motifs in favor of distinctly American
          imagery.

When you find a 1927 Buffalo Nickel in your collection or pocket change, you're holding a piece of American numismatic history that's nearly a century old. But exactly how much is this classic coin worth? The value of a 1927 Buffalo Nickel can range dramatically from just a few dollars to hundreds or even thousands, depending on several key factors.

![1927 Buffalo Nickel showing obverse and reverse sides with Native American portrait and buffalo design](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1927-buffalo-nickel-worth/how-much-is-a-1927-buffalo-nickel-worth-image-1_hRIcVgNNN.png)

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the factors that determine your 1927 Buffalo Nickel's value, from mint marks to condition grades and rare error varieties. By the end, you'll have the knowledge to accurately assess what your coin is truly worth in today's market.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="History of the Buffalo Nickel" level="2" >}}
The Buffalo Nickel, also known as the Indian Head Nickel, was designed by James Earle Fraser and minted from 1913 to 1938. It's one of America's most iconic coin designs, featuring a Native American chief on the obverse and an American bison (buffalo) on the reverse.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The Buffalo Nickel represents a significant departure from previous coin designs, embracing distinctly American imagery rather than classical European motifs. Fraser, who studied under Augustus Saint-Gaudens, created a coin that celebrated indigenous heritage and the American frontier.

![Close-up of the Buffalo Nickel design showing the Native American profile on the obverse side](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1927-buffalo-nickel-worth/how-much-is-a-1927-buffalo-nickel-worth-image-2_ViokdIajb.png)

For the obverse portrait, Fraser combined features from three Native American chiefs: Iron Tail (Sioux), Two Moons (Cheyenne), and John Big Tree (Seneca). The reverse features Black Diamond, a bison that lived in New York's Central Park Zoo.

{{< visual-modules/timeline title="Buffalo Nickel Production Timeline" >}}
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1913" title="First Buffalo Nickels Minted" >}}
    The first Buffalo Nickels were struck, with two design variations (Type 1 and Type 2) released in the same year.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1927" title="Three Mint Production" >}}
    Buffalo Nickels were produced at three mints: Philadelphia (no mint mark), Denver (D), and San Francisco (S).
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="1938" title="Production Ends" >}}
    The last Buffalo Nickels were struck, ending a 25-year run before being replaced by the Jefferson Nickel.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
{{< /visual-modules/timeline >}}

By 1927, the Buffalo Nickel had been in production for 14 years and had already established itself as an American classic. That year, three U.S. Mint facilities produced the coin: Philadelphia (no mint mark), Denver (D mint mark), and San Francisco (S mint mark).

{{< content-modules/section-header title="The 1927 Buffalo Nickel Specifications" level="2" >}}
Before assessing value, it's important to understand the physical characteristics of the 1927 Buffalo Nickel and what makes it distinctive from other years.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The 1927 Buffalo Nickel shares the same physical specifications as other years in the series:

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="1927 Buffalo Nickel Specifications" columns="3" / / />}}
- **Composition:** 75% copper, 25% nickel
- **Weight:** 5.0 grams
- **Diameter:** 21.2 mm
- **Edge:** Plain (smooth)
- **Designer:** James Earle Fraser
- **Obverse:** Native American profile
- **Reverse:** American bison (buffalo) on a mound

### Mint Marks and Production Numbers

The mint mark on a Buffalo Nickel is located on the reverse side, below "FIVE CENTS." For 1927, there were three different mint facilities producing these coins:

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1927 Buffalo Nickel Mintage Figures" description="Production quantity by mint facility" >}}
  <tr>
    <td>Philadelphia (No Mint Mark)</td>
    <td>37,981,000</td>
    <td>Highest production</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Denver (D)</td>
    <td>5,730,000</td>
    <td>Medium production</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>San Francisco (S)</td>
    <td>3,430,000</td>
    <td>Lowest production</td>
  </tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

The significantly lower mintage figures for the Denver and San Francisco coins make them more valuable, particularly in higher grades, compared to the Philadelphia issues.

![Image showing the location of mint marks on a 1927 Buffalo Nickel](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1927-buffalo-nickel-worth/how-much-is-a-1927-buffalo-nickel-worth-image-3_u6wINKgW1.png)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1927 Buffalo Nickel Value Based on Condition" level="2" >}}
The condition (grade) of your coin is one of the most significant factors affecting its value. Buffalo Nickels are graded on a scale from Poor (P-1) to Perfect Mint State (MS-70).
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Understanding Coin Grading

Before looking at specific values, it's important to understand the basic grading categories:

- **Circulated Grades** (P-1 to AU-58): Coins showing wear from circulation
- **Uncirculated Grades** (MS-60 to MS-70): Coins with no wear from circulation

For Buffalo Nickels, key details to examine include:

  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Cheek of the Native American (high point that wears first)" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Feathers in the headdress (detail often lost with wear)" / / />}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Valuable Error Varieties of the 1927 Buffalo Nickel" level="2" >}}
Error coins can be worth substantially more than their regular counterparts. Several error varieties exist for the 1927 Buffalo Nickel that collectors actively seek.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Double Die Obverse (DDO)

The 1927 Double Die Obverse error shows doubling in the date and sometimes in the lettering of "LIBERTY" and the Native American's features. This error occurs during the die manufacturing process when multiple impressions are made at slightly different angles.

{{< data-modules/price-table title="1927 DDO Buffalo Nickel Value" description="Market values for Double Die Obverse errors" >}}
  <tr>
    <td>Fine (F-12)</td>
    <td>$75.00 - $125.00</td>
    <td>Visible doubling despite wear</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Very Fine (VF-20)</td>
    <td>$150.00 - $225.00</td>
    <td>Clear doubling with moderate wear</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Extremely Fine (EF-40)</td>
    <td>$250.00 - $350.00</td>
    <td>Strong doubling with minimal wear</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mint State (MS-63)</td>
    <td>$750.00 - $1,000.00</td>
    <td>No wear, pronounced doubling</td>
  </tr>
{{< /data-modules/price-table >}}

### 1927-S DDO (San Francisco Double Die)

The San Francisco mint also produced a Double Die Obverse variety that shows more dramatic doubling than the Philadelphia version. These are quite rare and can command substantial premiums.

In a 2019 auction, a 1927-S DDO Buffalo Nickel in MS-63 condition sold for $840, demonstrating the significant premium these error coins can achieve.

### Repunched Mint Marks

Some 1927-D and 1927-S nickels show evidence of repunched mint marks, where the "D" or "S" was stamped multiple times at slightly different positions. These varieties typically sell for 20-50% more than standard examples in the same grade.

### Die Cracks and Cuds

Late-stage die cracks and cuds (raised areas of metal where a piece of the die has broken away) can add a 10-30% premium to the coin's value, depending on the size and location of the error.

![1927 Buffalo Nickel showing a die crack error variety](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-1927-buffalo-nickel-worth/how-much-is-a-1927-buffalo-nickel-worth-image-5_dzxMbK3Wm.png)

These auction results demonstrate the significant premium that high-grade examples and error coins can command in today's market. For the most common Philadelphia mint coins, the jump in value from MS-65 to MS-67 is particularly dramatic, illustrating the importance of quality within the uncirculated grades.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors That Affect Your 1927 Buffalo Nickel's Value" level="2" >}}
Beyond the basic mint mark and condition, several other factors can significantly impact what your 1927 Buffalo Nickel is worth.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### 1. Strike Quality

The quality of the strike can vary considerably among 1927 Buffalo Nickels. Coins with a strong, crisp strike that shows full detail in the buffalo's horn and the Native American's hair features will command a premium over weakly struck examples.

### 2. Original Surfaces

Buffalo Nickels with original surfaces and natural toning are preferred by collectors over coins that have been cleaned, polished, or chemically altered. Cleaning can reduce a coin's value by 50% or more.

### 3. Full Horn Detail

On the reverse of the Buffalo Nickel, the horn of the buffalo is a key focal point. Coins with a complete horn that shows full detail (known as "Full Horn" examples) can sell for 20-100% more than those with worn or weakly struck horns.

### 4. Luster Quality

For uncirculated coins, the quality and completeness of the mint luster significantly impacts value. Coins with full, cartwheel luster are worth more than those with dull or incomplete luster.

### 5. Professional Certification

Coins that have been authenticated, graded, and encapsulated by respected third-party grading services like PCGS or NGC typically command higher prices than ungraded examples, especially in higher grades where authenticity and accurate grading are crucial.

If you're interested in collecting 1927 Buffalo Nickels or building a larger Buffalo Nickel collection, here are some helpful tips.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Starting Your Collection

If you're new to collecting Buffalo Nickels, consider these approaches:

{{< interactive-modules/condition-checklist title="Beginner Collection Strategies" description="Ways to start collecting 1927 Buffalo Nickels" >}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Focus on acquiring one example from each mint (P, D, S)" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Start with affordable circulated examples in G-4 to F-12 grades" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Look for coins with clearly visible dates (a common issue with Buffalo Nickels)" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Avoid cleaned or damaged coins, even if they appear attractive" / / />}}
  {{< interactive-modules/checklist-item label="Consider investing in a good magnifying glass (10x) for examining details" / / />}}
{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

### Authentication and Grading

For more valuable examples, especially those in high grades or with potential errors, consider these guidelines:

1. **Third-Party Grading**: For coins potentially worth over $100, professional grading from PCGS or NGC is often worth the investment.

2. **Authenticity Verification**: Counterfeit Buffalo Nickels exist, particularly of key dates and mint marks. Professional grading services can verify authenticity.

3. **Proper Storage**: Use acid-free holders, not PVC-containing flips which can damage coins over time.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Preserving Your 1927 Buffalo Nickel's Value" level="2" >}}
Once you've acquired a 1927 Buffalo Nickel, proper preservation is essential to maintaining its value over time.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Storage Recommendations

To preserve your coin's condition and value:

1. **Use proper holders**: Non-PVC, acid-free coin holders, flips, or albums designed specifically for coins.

2. **Avoid handling**: When necessary, hold coins by their edges and consider using cotton gloves.

3. **Control environment**: Store in a cool, dry place with stable temperature and humidity.

4. **Never clean your coins**: Cleaning almost always reduces a coin's value, even if it makes the coin look "better" to the untrained eye.

5. **Consider slabbing**: For valuable specimens, professional encapsulation ("slabbing") by PCGS or NGC provides protection and authentication.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where is the mint mark on a 1927 Buffalo Nickel?" >}}
    The mint mark on a 1927 Buffalo Nickel is located on the reverse (buffalo) side, directly below the denomination "FIVE CENTS." If your coin was minted in Denver, you'll see a small "D" in this location. If it was minted in San Francisco, you'll see a small "S." Philadelphia-minted coins do not have a mint mark.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my 1927 Buffalo Nickel is valuable?" >}}
    To determine if your 1927 Buffalo Nickel is particularly valuable, check these key factors:
    
    1. Mint mark (D and S are worth more than no mint mark)
    2. Condition (higher grades are more valuable)
    3. Strike quality (look for full horn detail on the buffalo)
    4. Error varieties (look for doubling in the date or lettering)
    5. Original surfaces (uncleaned coins are worth more)
    
    Coins in uncirculated condition or with rare error varieties can be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the most valuable 1927 Buffalo Nickel?" >}}
    The most valuable 1927 Buffalo Nickels are the highest-grade examples from the San Francisco mint (1927-S). A 1927-S Buffalo Nickel in pristine Mint State (MS-67) condition can be worth $35,000 or more. Among error varieties, the 1927-S Double Die Obverse can command significant premiums, with examples in MS-63 condition selling for around $840 or more.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Does the 1927 Buffalo Nickel contain silver?" >}}
    No, the 1927 Buffalo Nickel does not contain any silver. It is composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel, giving it a silver-like appearance. The U.S. Mint did not use silver in the composition of five-cent pieces (nickels) during this period. The only U.S. nickels that contained silver were the "War Nickels" produced from mid-1942 to 1945.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the error on the 1927 Buffalo Nickel?" >}}
    The most notable error on 1927 Buffalo Nickels is the Double Die Obverse (DDO) variety, particularly on San Francisco-minted coins. This error shows doubling in the date, "LIBERTY," and sometimes in the Native American's features. Other errors include repunched mint marks (especially on D and S coins) and die cracks/cuds that formed as the dies wore out during the minting process.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I know if my 1927 Buffalo Nickel is authentic?" >}}
    To determine authenticity of a 1927 Buffalo Nickel:
    
    1. Check the weight (should be 5.0 grams)
    2. Examine the design details under magnification
    3. Look for the correct font style and positioning
    4. Verify the edge is plain (not reeded)
    5. Use a magnet (real nickels are not magnetic)
    
    For valuable specimens, consider professional authentication through PCGS or NGC, especially for high-grade or error coins where the financial stakes are higher.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Why is the date often worn off Buffalo Nickels?" >}}
    The date on Buffalo Nickels is frequently worn off because it was one of the highest points of the design and the first area to wear down during circulation. Additionally, the date was not recessed or protected in any way, making it particularly vulnerable to wear. This is why clearly dated Buffalo Nickels, even in lower grades, often command a premium over examples with worn dates.
