{{< content-modules/section-header title="Understanding Button Ages and Categories" level="2" >}}
Before diving into identification techniques, it's important to understand how buttons are categorized by age and how collectors typically classify them.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Collectors typically divide buttons into the following categories:

- **Antique Buttons**: Generally, buttons made before 1918 (over 100 years old)
- **Vintage Buttons**: Typically dated between 1918 and the 1980s
- **Modern Buttons**: Those made in recent decades

![Assortment of vintage and antique buttons arranged by type and age](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-buttons-identification/old-buttons-identification-image-2_-cnTMXX5i.png)

Within these broad categories, buttons are further classified by materials, manufacturing periods, and design styles. The National Button Society, founded in 1938, established a comprehensive classification system used by serious collectors, which divides buttons into divisions and classes based on materials, construction methods, and decorative elements.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Materials Used in Antique Buttons" level="2" >}}
One of the most reliable methods for identifying antique buttons is recognizing the materials from which they were made, as certain materials were popular during specific time periods.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Antique Button Material Statistics" columns="3" / />}}

### Natural Materials

**Shell**: Mother-of-pearl (or nacre) buttons were common from the 1800s through the early 1900s. They have a distinctive iridescent sheen and were often used on dress shirts, blouses, and undergarments. Pearl buttons from the Mississippi River "pearl rush" (1890s-1920s) are particularly collectible.

**Horn, Bone, and Ivory**: These animal-derived materials were widely used before plastics. Horn buttons often have a layered, translucent appearance, while bone buttons are more opaque with visible porous areas. Genuine ivory buttons (now illegal unless antique with proper documentation) have distinctive "Schreger lines" or grain patterns.

**Wood**: Wooden buttons range from simple utilitarian designs to intricately carved specimens. They were common from the 18th century onward and experienced a resurgence during wartime material shortages.

### Metals

**Brass**: A popular material for buttons, especially military and uniform buttons from the 18th-early 20th centuries. Look for tarnishing consistent with age and examine backmarks for manufacturer information.

**Steel**: Steel buttons became common in the 19th century and were often used for work clothes and uniforms. They may show rust or corrosion consistent with age.

**Pewter**: These soft metal buttons with a dull gray appearance were popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries. They often develop a distinctive patina over time.

**Silver and Gold**: Precious metal buttons were status symbols for the wealthy. Look for hallmarks indicating metal content and maker's marks.

### Glass and Ceramics

**Glass**: Glass buttons became widely available in the mid-19th century and remained popular through the early 20th century. They range from simple black glass "mourning buttons" to colorful hand-painted or molded designs.

**Porcelain and Ceramic**: Often hand-painted with delicate designs, these became popular in the late 18th century through the Victorian era. Staffordshire, Wedgwood, and Satsuma buttons are highly prized.

### Early Synthetic Materials

**Celluloid**: The first synthetic plastic, introduced in the 1860s and popular through the 1930s. It can be identified by its lightweight feel and often has a slight camphor smell when rubbed. It's highly flammable.

**Bakelite**: Developed in 1907 and popular through the 1940s. Authentic Bakelite produces a distinctive formaldehyde smell when rubbed with a hot needle (the "hot pin test") and makes a solid sound when tapped against teeth or hard surfaces.

**Lucite**: Popular from the 1940s onward, lucite buttons are often transparent or translucent with embedded designs, glitter, or bubbles.

![Close-up of various antique button materials including metal, glass, and mother-of-pearl](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-buttons-identification/old-buttons-identification-image-3_0aWpawY4OT.png)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Identifying Button Construction and Attachment Methods" level="2" >}}
The way a button is constructed and how it attaches to fabric can provide significant clues about its age and origin.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Attachment Methods

**Shanks**: 
- **Loop Shanks**: Simple wire loops - common in early buttons
- **Pad Shanks**: Metal base with attached loop - popular in the 19th century
- **Self Shanks**: Made from the same material as the button - found in various periods

The shank is often the most reliable indicator of a button's age:

1. **Twisted Wire Shanks** embedded in metal indicate manufacture before 1918
2. **Cast Shanks** that are integrated with the button body typically date from the 19th century
3. **Alpha Shanks** (shaped like an inverted omega symbol) were patented in 1918

**Sew-Through Holes**:
- **Two-Hole Buttons**: Common throughout button history
- **Four-Hole Buttons**: Became widespread in the 19th century
- **Unusual Hole Patterns**: Can help identify specific periods or manufacturers

### Construction Techniques

**Molded Buttons**: Mass-produced buttons made by pouring material into molds. Examine the seam lines and level of detail to determine age and quality.

**Riveted Buttons**: Multiple pieces joined together with small metal rivets, popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

**Fabric-Covered Buttons**: Often found on high-end garments, with designs reflecting the fashion of their period.

**Hand-Carved Buttons**: Look for slight irregularities and asymmetry indicating hand craftsmanship rather than machine production.

{{< /interactive-modules/condition-checklist >}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Recognizing Important Makers and Marks" level="2" >}}
Many antique buttons, particularly those made of metal, feature backmarks that can help identify their maker, origin, and sometimes date of manufacture.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Types of Backmarks

**Manufacturer's Marks**: Company names, logos, or initials stamped on the back of buttons. Examples include:
- "R. Scovill & Co." (1802-1840)
- "Scovill Mfg. Co." (1840-1866)
- "Waterbury Button Co." (1849-present)
- "Goodyear" (for hard rubber buttons, 1851-1870s)

**Patent Dates**: Many buttons include patent dates, which provide a definitive earliest possible date for the button. Remember that buttons may have been produced for many years after the patent date.

**Content Marks**: Especially on metal buttons, you might find marks indicating material composition:
- "Gilt" for gold-plated brass
- "Silver" or sterling marks on silver buttons
- "Paris" or "Paris Back" for a specific type of brass button

**Country of Origin**: After 1891, imported buttons were required to include the country of origin, such as "Made in France" or "Made in Czechoslovakia."

### Notable Button Manufacturers

- **Scovill Manufacturing Company**: One of America's oldest button makers, known for high-quality brass buttons
- **Waterbury Button Company**: Famous for uniform and military buttons
- **Schwanda & Sons**: Well-known Czech button maker (1830s-1940s)
- **Lacy, Pollard & Co.**: Important 19th-century British manufacturer
- **W. Boulton**: Prominent Birmingham button maker from the late 18th-early 19th centuries

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Evaluating Condition and Value" level="2" >}}
The condition of antique buttons significantly impacts their value. Understanding what collectors look for can help you better assess the worth of your finds.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Condition Factors Affecting Button Value

**Completeness**: Buttons with all original parts intact are most valuable. Missing shanks, chipped edges, or other damage decreases value.

**Surface Condition**: Look for:
- Scratches or abrasions
- Chips or cracks
- Color fading or discoloration
- Metal corrosion or inappropriate cleaning

**Originality**: Original finishes are preferred over refinished or restored buttons. Collectors value the natural patina that develops with age.

**Rarity**: Unusual materials, designs, or limited production runs command higher prices than common buttons.

4. **Handle with care**: Use cotton gloves when handling delicate buttons to prevent oils from your skin damaging finishes
5. **Join a community**: Connect with other collectors who can share knowledge and experience
6. **Build a reference library**: Invest in good identification guides specific to your collecting interests
7. **Practice identification**: Train your eye by examining known examples at museums or collector events

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Antique Button Identification" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I identify old buttons?" >}}
    To identify old buttons, examine these key features:

    - **Material**: Different materials were popular in specific eras (shell, metal, glass, early plastics)
    - **Construction**: Check the back for shank style or sew-through holes
    - **Markings**: Look for manufacturer's marks, patent dates, or country of origin
    - **Design style**: Note artistic elements that correspond to historical periods
    - **Wear patterns**: Authentic old buttons should show appropriate wear consistent with their age

    One particularly reliable method for metal buttons is examining the shank. If the shank is a twisted wire embedded in the metal, it was likely manufactured before 1918 and is considered an "antique" button.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do you identify old flat buttons?" >}}
    Flat button identification, particularly colonial-era metal buttons, can be done by examining:

    1. **Back seams**: Look for casting seams that indicate how the button was manufactured
    2. **Metal composition**: Colonial buttons were commonly made of brass, copper, pewter, or silver
    3. **Attachment method**: Early flat buttons often had a simple wire shank embedded in the back
    4. **Decorative elements**: Many colonial buttons featured simple designs or regimental/military motifs
    5. **Size and proportion**: Colonial buttons typically have a different scale than modern ones

    Military, political, or official buttons from this time period might have a rim, or the center could be formed around a pin. Authentic colonial buttons will show appropriate aging, patina, and wear patterns consistent with their age.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is there any value in old buttons?" >}}
    Yes, many old buttons can be quite valuable, especially to collectors. Factors affecting button value include:

    - **Age**: Pre-1918 buttons generally command higher prices
    - **Rarity**: Unusual designs, materials, or limited productions are more valuable
    - **Condition**: Buttons in excellent condition with original finishes are worth more
    - **Historical significance**: Military, political, or buttons with known provenance can be worth substantial amounts
    - **Artistic merit**: Buttons with fine craftsmanship or by notable makers fetch premium prices

    A complete antique button collection could be worth substantially more than individual buttons. Some rare individual buttons, particularly those with historical significance, can sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars at specialized auctions.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can you tell if a button is vintage?" >}}
    To determine if a button is truly vintage (generally 40-100 years old), look for these indicators:

    1. **Materials**: Vintage buttons often feature materials popular in specific decades (Bakelite from the 1930s-40s, Lucite from the 1940s-60s)
    2. **Manufacturing techniques**: Examine construction methods that match the claimed period
    3. **Design elements**: Check if the artistic style matches the era (Art Deco, Mid-Century Modern, etc.)
    4. **Maker's marks**: Research any back stamps or maker's marks to confirm authenticity
    5. **Age-appropriate wear**: Vintage buttons should show wear consistent with their age
    6. **Color palette**: Certain colors were popular in specific decades

    If available, compare the button to authenticated examples from reference books or museum collections.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the best way to clean antique buttons without damaging them?" >}}
    Cleaning antique buttons requires caution as improper methods can destroy value. Different materials require different approaches:

    - **Metal buttons**: Gently clean with a soft, dry toothbrush. Avoid harsh chemicals that remove patina, which collectors value.
    - **Pearl/shell buttons**: Wipe with a slightly damp soft cloth only. Never soak or use chemicals.
    - **Fabric buttons**: Light vacuuming with a small attachment and soft brush.
    - **Plastic buttons (Bakelite, celluloid)**: Wipe with a barely damp cloth. Never soak or use alcohol, which can damage these materials.
    - **Glass buttons**: Clean with mild soap and water, dry thoroughly.
    - **Wooden buttons**: Dust with a soft brush; never wet.

    When in doubt, consult a professional conservator, especially for valuable buttons. Often, excessive cleaning can reduce the value of antique buttons by removing their natural patina.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What were the most popular button materials used in different time periods?" >}}
    Button materials evolved significantly throughout history:

    - **Pre-1700s**: Horn, bone, wood, brass, pewter
    - **1700s-early 1800s**: Silver, pewter, brass, fabric-covered, paste (glass) jewels
    - **Mid-1800s**: Shell (mother-of-pearl), porcelain, glass, brass stamped designs
    - **Late 1800s (Victorian)**: Elaborate brass picture buttons, jet, glass, pearl, ivory
    - **Early 1900s**: Continued use of natural materials, early celluloid
    - **1920s-1930s**: Bakelite, celluloid, early synthetic materials, Art Deco designs
    - **1940s-1950s**: Lucite, plastic, modernist designs
    - **1960s-1970s**: Colorful plastics, novelty shapes, mod designs
    - **1980s-present**: Mass-produced plastics, return to natural materials in high-end garments

    This timeline helps collectors narrow down a button's age based on material composition.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are there any apps or digital tools to help identify antique buttons?" >}}
    While there isn't a dedicated app specifically for button identification (as of 2023), several digital resources can help:

    1. **General antique identification apps** like Google Lens can sometimes provide starting points for research
    2. **Online button forums** where collectors can post images for identification by experts
    3. **Digital archives** from museums with button collections
    4. **Subscription databases** like WorthPoint that include sold button auction listings with photos and descriptions
    5. **Pinterest boards** curated by button collectors with identified examples
    6. **Button collector websites** with searchable image galleries

    The National Button Society and other button collecting organizations also offer digital resources for members, including identification guides and archives.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What are the most valuable types of antique buttons to look for?" >}}
    The most valuable antique buttons typically include:
