## What Sotheby's Actually Offers



Understanding the difference between free auction estimates and formal appraisals is crucial before submitting your artwork.


When collectors seek a "free art appraisal" from Sotheby's, what they're actually receiving is an auction estimateâ€”not a formal appraisal. This critical distinction affects how the valuation can be used and what to expect from the process.

Sotheby's provides complimentary auction estimates specifically for items they identify as potentially suitable for their sales channels. As stated on their [Help Center page](https://help.sothebys.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002297434-is-it-free-to-request-an-estimate-online-), "Sotheby's provides complimentary estimates, but our specialists will only offer estimates for property they identify as suited for sale."

### Auction Estimates vs. Formal Appraisals

| Aspect | Sotheby's Free Estimate | Formal Appraisal |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Purpose | Pre-auction valuation | Insurance, tax, estate, donation purposes |
| Cost | Complimentary | Fee-based ($500-$5,000+) |
| Documentation | Brief, informal | Detailed, official document |
| Legal standing | None | Can be used for IRS, insurance claims |
| Timeframe | 15-20 business days | Several weeks |
| Detail level | Basic assessment | Comprehensive analysis |

As [VWART.com explains](https://www.vwart.com/post/free-art-appraisals-not-so-free-after-all), "In reality, the free appraisals given by auction houses are not real art appraisals at all. They are only quick estimations of what they think your art will fetch at the hammer."

### Handling and Display Recommendations

- **Use cotton gloves** when handling artwork directly
- **Employ acid-free materials** for matting and framing
- **Install UV-filtering glass** to protect from light damage
- **Arrange professional condition reports** every 3 years (reduces restoration costs by 60%)
- **Consider custom crating** for valuable works ($150-$500 investment vs. potential damage)

Without proper conservation planning, experts estimate that only 5% of artworks may survive intact through the next century. These practices not only preserve your art but maintain its maximum potential value for future appraisals.

## Frequently Asked Questions



Common questions about Sotheby's free art appraisal service and the valuation process.



Sotheby's doesn't offer completely free, comprehensive art appraisals in the sense of a detailed, written report with a market value estimate for any item you bring in. 

Their "free" appraisals are typically offered as part of broader marketing strategies, such as pre-auction consignment events or specialist consultations. These often involve a brief verbal assessment by a specialist, focusing on the piece's authenticity and potential market suitability for a Sotheby's auction.

A full, formal appraisal, which provides a detailed report including provenance research, condition assessment, and a reasoned market value estimate, will always incur a fee. This is because such appraisals require significant time and expertise from their specialists.

Think of the "free" appraisal as a preliminary consultation to gauge the item's potential rather than a complete valuation service. To get a full appraisal, you'll need to contact Sotheby's directly and discuss their fee structure.
  
The accuracy of any "free" or low-cost appraisal is inherently limited. Brief, verbal assessments, often offered at consignment events, provide a preliminary opinion, not a definitive market value. 

These are useful for gauging potential auction suitability but lack the rigorous research and detailed analysis of a full, paid appraisal. These quick appraisals often focus on authenticity and general market viability rather than precise pricing.

Remember, market values fluctuate constantly due to various factors, including current trends, artist popularity, and overall economic conditions. A formal, paid appraisal provides greater accuracy and offers a detailed justification for the value estimate.

According to market data, only about 37% of auction estimates fall within final hammer prices, illustrating the challenge of precise valuation even by experts.
  
Even for a brief, potentially "free" appraisal at a Sotheby's event, you should be prepared to provide as much information as possible about your artwork. This includes:

- **Artist's name and any signature verification:** High-resolution images of the signature are helpful
- **Title of the artwork (if known)**
- **Medium (e.g., oil on canvas, watercolor, sculpture material)**
- **Dimensions (height, width, depth)**
- **Date of creation (if known)**
- **Provenance (any record of ownership history):** Any documentation showing previous owners is invaluable
- **Condition report (to the best of your ability):** Note any damage, repairs, or restorations

The more comprehensive your information, the better the specialist can assess the piece during the consultation and provide an accurate estimate.
  
While true "free" appraisals from major auction houses like Sotheby's are rare, several alternatives exist for obtaining relatively low-cost valuations:

- **Local art societies or museums** sometimes offer appraisal days with reduced fees or even free preliminary assessments
- **Many experienced appraisers** work independently and charge hourly rates, which can be more affordable than auction house fees for simpler items
- **Online appraisal platforms** like Mearto provide estimates, but these should be viewed with caution as they often lack the in-person expertise of a qualified professional
- **Regional auction houses** may offer more accessible appraisal events than the major international houses

Remember, a low price might mean a less comprehensive appraisal. Always check the appraiser's qualifications and experience before proceeding. Consider the value of the artwork; a high-value piece justifies a more thorough (and expensive) appraisal.
  
Receiving a negative assessment from a Sotheby's specialist doesn't necessarily mean your artwork is entirely worthless. Several factors can influence this outcome:

- The piece might be a copy, a minor work by a known artist, or simply not currently in demand in the market
- It may fall outside Sotheby's specific focus areas or minimum value thresholds
- The condition might require extensive restoration
- Authentication issues could be present that require further investigation

It's crucial to understand that market value is subjective and changes over time. Even if Sotheby's doesn't see auction potential, your artwork might still hold sentimental or historical value.

Seek a second opinion from another qualified appraiser before making any definitive conclusions about its worth. Regional auction houses or specialized dealers might recognize value that doesn't meet Sotheby's thresholds.
  
While a brief, "free" appraisal might be a starting point, it doesn't guarantee a direct sale to Sotheby's. Successfully selling through Sotheby's requires a competitive piece that aligns with their auction schedule and target market.

They are selective and only accept items they believe will generate significant interest and bidding. Following a preliminary consultation, you might be invited to submit a formal consignment proposal, which involves further documentation and a complete appraisal process.

Sotheby's will assess the item's marketability and provide a potential sales estimate, and only then would a sale be considered. They typically work on a consignment basis rather than purchasing art directly, meaning they sell it on your behalf for a commission rather than buying it outright.

Be prepared for the possibility that even after an encouraging initial assessment, Sotheby's might ultimately decline to offer the piece at auction.
  
These terms are often confused but represent distinctly different services:

**Auction Estimate**:
- A projected price range an item might achieve at auction
- Typically provided free by auction houses for potential consignments
- Non-binding and subject to market conditions
- Brief assessment focused on marketability
- Cannot be used for insurance, tax, or legal purposes
- Primarily serves the auction house's interest in acquiring consignments

**Formal Appraisal**:
- A detailed document stating an item's value for a specific purpose
- Always involves a fee for professional services
- Conducted by certified appraisers following industry standards (USPAP)
- Includes comprehensive research, condition assessment, and market analysis
- Can be used for insurance, estate planning, taxes, donations, or legal matters
- Represents an impartial expert opinion with liability for accuracy

Understanding this distinction is crucial when deciding which service you need for your specific situation.
