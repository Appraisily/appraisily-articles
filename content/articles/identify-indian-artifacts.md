{{< content-modules/section-header title="Major Types of Native American Artifacts" level="2" >}}
  Understanding the different categories of Native American artifacts will help with proper identification. Each type has distinctive characteristics based on materials, craftsmanship, and regional variations.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Projectile Points and Arrowheads

Projectile points are among the most commonly found and collected Native American artifacts. These stone tools were attached to spears, darts, or arrows and used for hunting and warfare. Identifying authentic projectile points requires examining material, shape, craftsmanship, and regional patterns.

![Various types of Native American arrowheads and projectile points showing different shapes and materials](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/identify-indian-artifacts/identify-indian-artifacts-image-2_iW1U_zt3X.png)

Key identification features of projectile points include:

1. **Material**: Most points are made from flint, chert, obsidian, or other lithic materials that could be flaked to create sharp edges.

2. **Flaking Patterns**: Authentic points show deliberate flaking patterns where small pieces were systematically removed to shape the tool.

3. **Base Design**: The base (bottom part) of projectile points varies significantly by culture and time periodâ€”from notched to stemmed to lanceolate designs.

4. **Regional Variations**: Point styles vary dramatically by region, with distinct types associated with specific cultural periods and geographic areas.

The [Arrowhead Identification Database](https://typology.arrowheads.com/) catalogs over 1,000 individual point types with 60,000+ photographs, serving as an invaluable resource for identification.

### Stone Tools and Implements

Beyond projectile points, Native Americans created a wide variety of stone tools for daily use, including:

1. **Axes and Celts**: Ground stone tools with sharp edges used for woodworking and clearing.

2. **Scrapers**: Tools used to clean hides, shape wood, or process plant materials.

3. **Grinding Stones**: Used for processing grains, seeds, and other food items.

4. **Hammerstones**: Used for percussion flaking when making other tools.

{{< visual-modules/hero-image src="https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/identify-indian-artifacts/identify-indian-artifacts-image-3_OZMR9JIee.png" alt="Examples of Native American stone tools including grinding stones, axes, and hammerstones" caption="Various stone tools including ground stone axes, grinding stones, and hammerstones" />}}

When identifying stone tools, look for these characteristics:

- **Evidence of Use-Wear**: Authentic tools often show wear patterns consistent with their purpose.
- **Intentional Shaping**: Tools display evidence of deliberate shaping through grinding, flaking, or pecking.
- **Material Selection**: Specific stone types were chosen for particular tools based on their properties.
- **Regional Patterns**: Tool styles and materials often reflect local resources and traditions.

### Pottery and Ceramics

Pottery provides valuable insights into Native American cultures, as styles, decorations, and manufacturing techniques varied widely across regions and time periods.

Key identification features of Native American pottery include:

1. **Construction Method**: Most traditional pottery was hand-built using coil, paddle-and-anvil, or modeling techniques, rather than wheel-thrown.

2. **Surface Treatment**: Look for distinctive treatments such as polishing, burnishing, incising, painting, or stamping.

3. **Temper Material**: Materials added to clay for strength (such as sand, crushed shell, or plant fibers) can indicate regional origin.

4. **Firing Evidence**: Traditional pottery was often open-fired, resulting in distinctive fire clouds or color variations.

5. **Decorative Elements**: Design motifs and patterns often reflect specific cultural traditions and time periods.

### Signs of Authenticity vs. Natural Objects

Many people mistake naturally occurring rocks for artifacts. Here's how to tell the difference:

1. **Deliberate Flaking**: Authentic stone tools show intentional, systematic removal of flakes to create sharp edges or specific shapes.

2. **Symmetry and Design**: Human-made artifacts typically display greater symmetry and purposeful design than natural stones.

3. **Use-Wear Patterns**: Authentic tools often show distinctive patterns of wear consistent with human use.

4. **Material Selection**: Native Americans selected specific stone types for particular tools based on their properties.

As one Quora respondent noted, "To be an artifact, it should show some wear. If flint or obsidian, flakes will be removed, shaping it up. Hammerstones will show use, often with pitting on the ends."

### Spotting Modern Reproductions

The market for Native American artifacts has unfortunately led to numerous reproductions and fakes. Here's how to spot them:

1. **Manufacturing Marks**: Look for evidence of modern tools like saw marks, drill holes with perfectly circular edges, or machine polishing.

2. **Artificial Aging**: Reproductions may show artificial patinas or staining intended to mimic age.

3. **Inconsistent Materials**: Reproductions might use materials not historically available in the region they claim to represent.

4. **Unrealistic Condition**: Artifacts in suspiciously perfect condition may be modern reproductions.

5. **Price Too Good to Be True**: Extremely rare or high-quality artifacts offered at surprisingly low prices often indicate reproductions.

### Storage and Handling Guidelines

To properly preserve artifacts:

1. **Minimize Handling**: Use clean, dry hands or cotton gloves when handling artifacts.

2. **Store in Stable Environments**: Maintain consistent temperature and humidity levels (ideally 65-70Â°F with 40-60% relative humidity).

3. **Use Archival Materials**: Store artifacts in acid-free boxes, tissue, or polyethylene bags.

4. **Avoid Direct Sunlight**: UV light can fade pigments and degrade organic materials.

5. **Label Properly**: Use pencil on acid-free tags rather than writing directly on artifacts.

6. **Keep Records**: Maintain detailed documentation of each artifact, including provenance information.

### Conservation Concerns

Different materials require specific conservation approaches:

1. **Stone Artifacts**: Generally stable but may be damaged by improper cleaning. Use soft brushes, avoid chemicals.

2. **Pottery**: Fragile and should be supported adequately. Never use adhesive tape directly on pottery.

3. **Organic Materials**: Particularly vulnerable to environmental changes and pest damage. May require specialized conservation.

4. **Metal Artifacts**: Historic metal items require stabilization to prevent corrosion. Consult a conservator for treatment.

When in doubt about conservation needs, consult a professional conservator through the American Institute for Conservation.

    2. Complete pottery vessels: Especially painted pieces from the Southwest or Mississippi Valley, which can command prices from $5,000 to $20,000+ depending on condition, age, and decoration
    
    3. Rare ceremonial items: Including effigy pipes, banner stones, and bird stones in excellent condition
    
    4. Pre-contact art objects: Including carved stone or bone figurines
    
    5. Well-documented pieces with clear provenance: Historical documentation significantly increases value
    
    Value is heavily influenced by age, condition, rarity, aesthetic appeal, and having proper documentation of provenance.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if a stone is an Indian artifact?" >}}
    Distinguishing natural stones from artifacts requires looking for these key indicators:
    
    1. Evidence of intentional flaking: Look for systematic removal of flakes from the edges, creating sharper surfaces than would occur naturally
    
    2. Symmetry and balance: Human-made tools typically show greater symmetry than naturally broken stones
    
    3. Use-wear patterns: Authentic tools often show distinctive patterns of wear from human use (polished areas, striations, or impact marks)
    
    4. Material selection: Artifacts are typically made from specific stone types selected for their properties (flint, chert, obsidian for cutting tools; harder stones for hammers)
    
    5. Cultural modifications: Look for drill holes, notches, or grinding that wouldn't occur naturally
    
    When in doubt, consult with professional archaeologists who can examine microscopic wear patterns and other subtle indicators.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is it legal to collect Native American artifacts?" >}}
    The legality of collecting Native American artifacts depends on several factors:
    
    1. Location: It is illegal to collect artifacts from public lands (federal, state, or local) without permits. This includes national parks, forests, BLM land, and state parks.
    
    2. Land ownership: On private property, ownership rights vary by state, but generally, landowners may legally keep artifacts found on their own property (though some states require reporting significant finds).
    
    3. Type of artifact: Human remains and funerary objects are protected by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) regardless of where they're found.
    
    4. Age and significance: Some states have laws protecting artifacts over a certain age or of particular historical significance.
    
    Even when legally permitted, consider the ethical implications and scientific value lost when artifacts are removed from their archaeological context without proper documentation. Always check current federal, state, and local regulations before collecting.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I determine the age of a Native American artifact?" >}}
    Determining the age of Native American artifacts typically involves:
    
    1. Typological dating: Comparing the artifact's style, form, and manufacturing technique to established chronologies of similar dated artifacts
    
    2. Context: Where and with what other materials the artifact was found provides important chronological clues
    
    3. Material: Certain materials were used in specific time periods
    
    4. Patination and weathering: The degree of surface weathering can suggest relative age
    
    5. Scientific dating methods: For more precise dating, techniques like radiocarbon dating (for organic materials), thermoluminescence (for pottery), or obsidian hydration (for obsidian artifacts) may be used by professionals
    
    Accurate dating typically requires professional analysis and is most reliable when artifacts are found in undisturbed archaeological contexts rather than surface finds.

    For professional appraisal of Native American artifacts, consider these resources:
    
    1. Specialized auction houses: Houses like Skinner, Bonhams, or Sotheby's with Native American departments offer appraisal services
    
    2. Certified appraisers: Look for appraisers certified by the International Society of Appraisers (ISA) or the American Society of Appraisers (ASA) with specialization in Native American items
    
    3. Museum curators: Some museum professionals may offer informal assessments or referrals
    
    4. Reputable dealers: Established dealers specializing in Native American artifacts may provide market value estimates
    
    5. Appraisal events: Some museums and archaeology organizations hold "artifact identification days" where experts can provide general information
    
    Always seek multiple opinions for valuable items, and be prepared to provide provenance information. Beware of appraisers who also offer to purchase your items, as this represents a conflict of interest.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How should I clean artifacts I've found?" >}}
    As a general rule, minimal cleaning is best for archaeological artifacts:
    
    1. For stone tools: Gently remove loose soil with a soft brush. If necessary, use plain water and a soft toothbrush, allowing the item to air dry completely.
    
    2. For pottery: Never soak pottery fragments as this can dissolve remaining organic residues important for analysis. Gently brush away soil with a soft, dry brush.
    
    3. For metal objects: Do not clean historic metal artifacts without professional guidance, as improper cleaning can accelerate deterioration.
    
    4. For organic materials (bone, shell, wood): These require specialized conservation. Only remove loose soil with a soft brush.
    
    Avoid using chemicals, soaking items, or scrubbing vigorously. Remember that soil, residues, and patinas may contain valuable archaeological information. When in doubt, consult a professional conservator before attempting any cleaning.
