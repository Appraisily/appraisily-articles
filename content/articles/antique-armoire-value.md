      text: >-
        In the antiques market, a true antique is typically considered to be at
        least 100 years old. However, many collectors and dealers focus on
        specific design periods rather than just age. For armoires, this often
        means pieces from the Renaissance period (16th century), Baroque period
        (17th century), Rococo and Neoclassical periods (18th century), Empire
        and Victorian periods (19th century), and Art Nouveau and Art Deco
        periods (early 20th century). Many high-quality armoires from the
        1920-1949 period are also highly collectible, though technically
        classified as 'vintage' rather than true antiques.

    acceptedAnswer:
      '@type': Answer
      text: >-
        The value of an antique armoire is influenced by numerous factors
        including age and period (older armoires from significant design periods
        like Louis XV or Renaissance generally command higher prices),
        condition, provenance, craftsmanship, materials used, and current market
        trends.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Introduction to Antique Armoires" level="2" >}}
Antique armoires represent some of the most impressive and functional furniture pieces from past centuries. Originally designed as storage solutions before the advent of built-in closets, these freestanding cabinets have become highly sought-after collectibles that combine historical significance with practical utility.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Armoires have evolved significantly over the centuries, from simple utilitarian storage pieces to elaborately carved status symbols. Understanding the value of an antique armoire requires knowledge of historical styles, craftsmanship techniques, woods used, and current market conditions.

Whether you've inherited a family heirloom, discovered a potential treasure at an estate sale, or are considering investing in antique furniture, this comprehensive guide will help you determine the true value of antique armoires and make informed decisions about buying, selling, or preserving these magnificent pieces.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="What Makes an Armoire 'Antique'?" level="2" >}}
Before determining value, it's important to understand what qualifies as a genuine antique armoire versus a vintage or reproduction piece. While definitions can vary somewhat among collectors and dealers, there are generally accepted standards.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

In the antiques market, a true antique is typically considered to be at least 100 years old. However, many collectors and dealers focus on specific design periods rather than just age. For armoires, this often means pieces from the:

- Renaissance period (16th century)
- Baroque period (17th century)
- Rococo and Neoclassical periods (18th century)
- Empire and Victorian periods (19th century)
- Art Nouveau and Art Deco periods (early 20th century)

Many high-quality armoires from the 1920-1949 period are also highly collectible, though technically classified as "vintage" rather than true antiques.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Key Factors That Determine Antique Armoire Value" level="2" >}}
The value of an antique armoire is influenced by numerous factors. Understanding these elements will help you assess the potential worth of any piece you encounter.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="Primary Value Factors" columns="3" / / />}}

1. **Age and Period**: Generally, older armoires command higher prices, especially those from significant design periods like Louis XV or Renaissance.

2. **Provenance and History**: Documentation proving ownership by notable figures or from important estates can significantly increase value.

3. **Condition**: Original finishes, hardware, and minimal restoration typically result in higher valuations.

4. **Materials**: The type of wood and quality of materials used impacts value significantly.

5. **Craftsmanship**: Hand-carved details, dovetail joinery, and master craftsman signatures increase worth.

6. **Rarity**: Uncommon styles, unique features, or limited production pieces command premium prices.

7. **Size and Proportions**: Larger, more imposing pieces often (but not always) bring higher prices.

8. **Regional Variations**: French, English, German, and American armoires have different value profiles.

Let's explore each of these factors in more detail to help you accurately assess any antique armoire.

{{< visual-modules/timeline title="Evolution of Armoire Styles and Values" >}}
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="16th-17th Century" title="Renaissance & Baroque" >}}
    Early armoires were simple oak storage pieces with minimal decoration. Later Baroque examples introduced more elaborate carving and ornamentation. Values range from $5,000-$25,000+ depending on condition and provenance.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="18th Century" title="Rococo & Neoclassical" >}}
    French Louis XV and XVI armoires represent the height of armoire craftsmanship with elaborate carving, marquetry, and gilding. These pieces often command $10,000-$50,000 depending on quality and condition.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="19th Century" title="Victorian & Empire" >}}
    Mass production began, with ornate pieces featuring detailed carvings, mirrors, and romantic imagery. English Victorian wardrobes typically range from $2,000-$8,000, while high-end French pieces can reach $15,000.
  {{< /visual-modules/timeline-item >}}
  
  {{< visual-modules/timeline-item date="Early 20th Century" title="Art Nouveau & Art Deco" >}}

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Identifying Valuable Antique Armoire Styles" level="2" >}}
Different regions and time periods produced distinctive armoire styles, each with their own value profile in today's market. Learning to recognize these styles is crucial for accurate valuation.

### French Armoires

French armoires are among the most coveted and valuable antiques in the furniture market. Key styles include:

**Louis XIII (1610-1643)**: Characterized by architectural elements, columns, and carved panels. Typically constructed from walnut or oak. Value range: $5,000-$15,000.

**Louis XIV (1643-1715)**: More ornate with bold carvings, often featuring mythological motifs. Value range: $8,000-$20,000.

**Louis XV (1715-1774)**: Curved lines, asymmetrical designs, and floral motifs. Among the most valuable, with prices ranging from $10,000-$50,000 for exceptional examples.

**Louis XVI (1774-1793)**: More restrained and geometric than Louis XV, with neoclassical elements. Value range: $7,000-$30,000.

**French Provincial**: Regional variations of court styles, often simpler but still beautifully crafted. Value range: $3,000-$15,000.

### English Wardrobes

English pieces (often called wardrobes rather than armoires) follow different design traditions:

**Georgian (1714-1837)**: Elegant proportions with minimal decoration, often in mahogany. Value range: $3,000-$12,000.

**Victorian (1837-1901)**: Heavier and more ornate, often featuring mirrors and elaborate carved details. Value range: $1,500-$8,000.

**Edwardian (1901-1910)**: Lighter in appearance than Victorian, with refined inlay work. Value range: $1,200-$5,000.

### American Armoires

American examples tend to be more practical and less ornate:

**Colonial (18th century)**: Simple designs in pine or maple. Value range: $2,000-$10,000.

**Federal (1780-1820)**: Elegant proportions with minimal decoration. Value range: $3,000-$15,000.

**Victorian (19th century)**: Often featuring carved details and walnut veneer. Value range: $1,200-$6,000.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Wood Types and Their Impact on Value" level="2" >}}
The type of wood used in an antique armoire significantly affects its value. Different periods and regions favored particular woods based on availability, workability, and aesthetic appeal.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

**Oak**: Common in earlier pieces (16th-17th century), especially from England, Germany, and Northern France. Oak is durable but coarser-grained, making detailed carving more challenging. Oak armoires typically range from $2,000-$12,000 depending on age and style.

**Walnut**: Highly prized for its beautiful grain and carving properties. Popular for French and Italian pieces from the 17th-19th centuries. Walnut armoires generally command $3,000-$25,000.

**Mahogany**: Became popular in the 18th century, especially for English pieces. Known for its rich reddish-brown color and fine grain. Mahogany armoires typically range from $2,500-$18,000.

**Rosewood and Exotic Woods**: Used for high-end pieces, particularly during the 19th century and Art Deco period. These can command $4,000-$30,000 depending on design and condition.

**Pine**: Often used for country and provincial pieces. While less prestigious than hardwoods, antique pine armoires have gained popularity for their rustic charm. Values typically range from $1,200-$8,000.

**Satinwood, Fruitwoods, and Maple**: Often used for inlay, marquetry, or secondary woods. Pieces featuring these woods as primary materials can range from $2,000-$15,000.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Assessing Condition and Originality" level="2" >}}
The condition of an antique armoire can dramatically impact its value. Collectors and dealers typically place the highest premium on pieces with original finishes, hardware, and minimal restoration.

### Understanding "Condition Terminology"

When researching antique armoire values, you'll encounter these common condition descriptions:

**Mint/Museum Quality**: Nearly perfect condition, with original finish, hardware, and minimal wear. These pieces command the highest prices, often 2-3 times the value of those in "good" condition.

**Excellent**: Minor wear consistent with age, original finish and hardware, no major repairs. Typically commands 1.5-2 times the value of those in "good" condition.

**Very Good**: Some wear and minor repairs, but maintaining overall integrity and charm. May have had minor restoration. Typically priced 1.2-1.5 times those in "good" condition.

**Good**: Shows wear appropriate for age, may have had some repairs or restoration. This is the baseline for most price guides.

**Fair**: Functional but with significant wear, repairs, or alterations. Often priced at 60-80% of "good" condition examples.

**Poor**: Major structural issues, significant missing elements, or inappropriate modifications. Often valued primarily for restoration potential, typically at 30-50% of "good" examples.

### Impact of Restoration on Value

When evaluating an antique armoire that has been restored, consider:

1. **Quality of Restoration**: Expert, period-appropriate restoration detracts less from value than amateur work.

2. **Extent of Restoration**: Minor touch-ups affect value less than complete refinishing.

3. **Disclosure**: Properly documented restoration with before/after photos can help maintain value.

4. **Structural vs. Cosmetic**: Structural repairs (replacing broken parts) generally impact value more than cosmetic restoration.

5. **Appropriateness**: Period-appropriate materials and techniques preserve more value than modern shortcuts.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Authentication and Avoiding Reproductions" level="2" >}}
The market contains many reproduction armoires that can be difficult to distinguish from genuine antiques. Learning to identify authentic pieces is essential for making sound investments and accurate valuations.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Signs of Authentic Antique Armoires

**Construction Methods**:
- Hand-cut dovetail joints (often irregular in older pieces)
- Mortise and tenon joinery
- Signs of hand planing on interior surfaces
- Wood pins rather than screws in early pieces
- Cut nails in 19th century pieces

**Materials**:
- Old-growth wood with tight, consistent grain patterns
- Uneven color patina that develops naturally over time
- Secondary woods appropriate to the period (poplar, pine, oak)

**Hardware**:
- Hand-forged or cast iron hinges and locks in earlier pieces
- Brass hardware with an aged patina in later pieces
- Evidence of hand finishing on metal components

**Wear Patterns**:
- Consistent wear in areas of natural use (door edges, handles)
- Drawer runners worn from centuries of use
- Floor-facing areas with authentic wear patterns

![Close-up view of authentic aged patina and hardware on an antique armoire](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/antique-armoire-value/antique-armoire-value-image-5_VnIeRf0iJ.png)

### Common Reproduction Red Flags

Beware of these indicators that an armoire may be a modern reproduction:

1. **Perfect Symmetry**: Hand-crafted antiques have slight imperfections; too-perfect proportions suggest machine production.

2. **Modern Fasteners**: Phillips-head screws or modern nails hidden in joints.

3. **Uniform Aging**: Artificially distressed pieces often show too-consistent "aging" patterns.

4. **Inconsistent Woods**: Using woods that weren't historically paired together.

5. **Machine-Cut Dovetails**: Perfectly regular dovetails indicating power tools.

6. **Inappropriate Finish**: Modern polyurethane or lacquer finishes instead of shellac, oil, or wax.

7. **Sharp Carvings**: Overly crisp carvings without appropriate wear.

8. **Composite Materials**: Particle board, MDF, or plywood (except in some Art Deco pieces).

9. **Hybrid Styles**: Mixing distinctive period elements that wouldn't historically appear together.

10. **Uniform Color**: Lack of color variation that develops with natural aging.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Market Trends and Value Fluctuations" level="2" >}}
The antique armoire market has experienced significant changes over the past decades. Understanding current trends can help you make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding these pieces.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Current Market Dynamics

While the overall antique furniture market has seen some declines since the early 2000s, certain segments remain strong:

1. **High-end French pieces**: Museum-quality French armoires from the 18th century continue to appreciate, particularly those with documented provenance.

2. **Versatility premium**: Armoires that can be repurposed as entertainment centers, home bars, or computer stations often command higher prices in today's market.

3. **Simplified aesthetics**: Clean-lined Empire, Biedermeier, and Art Deco armoires have gained popularity as they blend better with contemporary interiors.

4. **Painted country pieces**: Rustic provincial armoires, especially those with original paint, have maintained strong market interest.

5. **Specialized collectors**: Certain niche areas like Art Nouveau, Danish Modern, and specific regional styles maintain dedicated collector bases.

### Factors Affecting Future Values

Several factors will likely influence antique armoire values in coming years:

1. **Sustainability focus**: As environmental awareness grows, the value of solid, durable antiques may increase relative to new furniture.

2. **Housing trends**: Smaller living spaces may reduce demand for oversized pieces but increase interest in more compact armoires.

3. **Digital accessibility**: Online marketplaces have expanded the buyer pool but also increased competition among sellers.

4. **Generational shifts**: Changing tastes among younger collectors may further elevate certain styles while depressing others.

5. **Supply constraints**: The finite supply of genuine antiques, particularly pre-19th century examples, suggests long-term value stability for the finest pieces.

Whether you're looking to acquire or sell an antique armoire, understanding the various marketplace options can help you achieve the best outcome.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Best Places to Find Authentic Antique Armoires

1. **Established Antique Dealers**: Specialists like [Fireside Antiques](https://www.firesideantiques.com/inventory/furniture/storage/armoires-case-pieces/) offer vetted pieces with condition reports and provenance details.

2. **Auction Houses**: Major houses like Sotheby's, Christie's, and Bonhams offer authenticated pieces, while regional auction houses may present better value opportunities.

3. **Antique Shows and Fairs**: Events like the Winter Antiques Show in New York, Brimfield in Massachusetts, or Round Top in Texas offer opportunities to examine pieces in person and negotiate directly.

4. **Online Marketplaces**: Platforms such as [1stDibs](https://www.1stdibs.com), [Chairish](https://www.chairish.com/collection/armoires), and [Pamono](https://www.pamono.com/vintage-armoires) curate higher-end pieces, while eBay and Etsy can offer more moderate options.

5. **Estate Sales**: Often provide opportunities to find undiscovered pieces at competitive prices.

6. **Decorative Arts Dealers**: Shops specializing in specific periods or regional styles can be excellent sources for authenticated pieces.

### Selling Strategies for Maximum Value

When selling an antique armoire, consider these approaches:

1. **Consignment vs. Direct Sale**: High-end pieces often benefit from auction house or dealer consignment despite the fees, while mid-range pieces might net more through direct sales.

2. **Documentation Preparation**: Gather any provenance information, previous appraisals, and detailed photographs highlighting key features.

3. **Professional Appraisal**: An independent appraisal from a qualified expert can substantiate asking prices and attract serious buyers.

4. **Strategic Timing**: Consider seasonal factors—decorative antiques often sell better in autumn as people prepare for holiday entertaining.

5. **Presentation**: Simple cleaning (not refinishing) and professional photography can significantly impact perceived value.

6. **Market Matching**: Target your selling platform to the specific style and value of your piece—high-end French pieces deserve different marketing than country pine armoires.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Care and Preservation" level="2" >}}
Proper maintenance can preserve both the historical integrity and financial value of an antique armoire. Following best practices for care will ensure these pieces continue to be enjoyed for generations.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Essential Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Climate Control**: Maintain consistent temperature and humidity (ideally 40-60% relative humidity). Extreme fluctuations can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and joint separation.

2. **Cleaning**: Dust regularly with a soft, lint-free cloth. For deeper cleaning, use a mild solution of Murphy's Oil Soap and water, applied sparingly with a slightly damp cloth and immediately dried.

3. **Polishing**: Use traditional wax-based products like beeswax or carnauba wax rather than silicone-based polishes that can build up over time. Apply sparingly 2-3 times per year.

4. **Hardware Maintenance**: Clean brass hardware with a soft cloth and mild brass cleaner. For iron hardware, remove surface rust with fine steel wool and apply paste wax to prevent further oxidation.

5. **Structural Support**: Place armoires on level surfaces and consider reinforcing floors under particularly heavy pieces. Avoid placing directly against exterior walls that may transfer dampness.

6. **Light Exposure**: Protect from direct sunlight which can fade finishes and woods unevenly. Consider UV-filtering window treatments.

7. **Moving Techniques**: Always empty before moving, remove doors if possible, and lift from structural points rather than decorative elements.

### Professional Services Worth Considering

For valuable antique armoires, these specialized services may be worthwhile:

1. **Conservation Assessment**: A professional conservator can evaluate condition and recommend specific preservation strategies.

2. **Custom Climate Control**: For museum-quality pieces, dedicated climate control systems might be justified.

3. **Insurance Appraisal**: Updated documentation of value ensures proper coverage.

4. **Cabinet Security**: Custom locks or security systems for high-value pieces containing valuables.

5. **Specialized Transportation**: When moving valuable armoires, professional art and antique movers use techniques that minimize risk.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Investment Potential and Collecting Strategy" level="2" >}}
For those interested in antique armoires as an investment rather than just for aesthetic or functional purposes, developing a thoughtful collecting strategy is essential.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Evaluating Investment Potential

Consider these factors when assessing the investment potential of antique armoires:

1. **Historical Significance**: Pieces associated with important design movements or historical events typically maintain value better than more common examples.

2. **Rarity Factor**: Unusual sizes, regional variations, or exceptional craftsmanship contribute to long-term value retention.

3. **Condition Premium**: Museum-quality pieces command increasingly higher premiums as the supply of untouched examples diminishes.

4. **Documented Provenance**: Armoires with verifiable histories of ownership, especially by notable individuals or from important collections, tend to appreciate more reliably.

5. **Adaptability**: Pieces that can serve multiple functions in modern interiors (storage, media cabinets, home bars) may have broader appeal to future buyers.

### Building a Focused Collection

For serious collectors, these approaches can guide a more structured collecting strategy:

1. **Period Specialization**: Focus on a specific design period (Louis XV, Art Deco, etc.) to develop deep expertise and recognize exceptional examples.

2. **Regional Focus**: Concentrate on armoires from a particular region (Normandy, Alsace, English Midlands) to understand regional characteristics and rarities.

3. **Evolution Collection**: Acquire representative examples showing the evolution of the armoire through different periods.

4. **Craftsman/Workshop Identification**: Learn to recognize the distinctive features of specific workshops or master craftsmen.

5. **Documentation Practice**: Maintain detailed records of provenance, condition assessments, restoration history, and purchase information for each piece.

6. **Market Monitoring**: Track auction results and dealer prices for comparable pieces to gauge market movements.

7. **Relationship Building**: Develop relationships with specialized dealers who can alert you to important pieces before they reach the open market.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What is the difference between an armoire and a wardrobe?" >}}
    While often used interchangeably, there are subtle distinctions:

    - **Armoires** traditionally originated in France and were often more ornate with carved decorations. They typically featured shelving and hanging space, and sometimes had drawers at the bottom.
    
    - **Wardrobes** developed primarily in England and tend to be more specifically designed for hanging clothes, often with greater interior organization. English wardrobes frequently feature mirrored doors.
    
    This distinction has blurred over time, and today the terms are often used based on stylistic features rather than strict functional differences. French-styled pieces are typically called armoires, while English-styled pieces are often called wardrobes.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How heavy is a solid wood antique armoire?" >}}
    Antique armoires can be surprisingly heavy due to their solid construction and the dense hardwoods used. Weight varies significantly based on size and wood type, but typical ranges are:
    
    - Medium-sized oak or walnut armoires: 200-280 pounds
    - Large mahogany or rosewood armoires: 300-450 pounds
    - Massive carved pieces with thick panels: 500+ pounds
    
    This substantial weight makes proper moving techniques essential to avoid damage to both the piece and your home. Professional movers with experience handling antiques are recommended for valuable pieces.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="When did wardrobes and armoires first become popular?" >}}
    The evolution of wardrobes and armoires spans several centuries:
    
    - **14th century**: The term "wardrobe" initially referred to a room for storing clothing
    - **16th century**: Free-standing wardrobes began appearing as furniture pieces
    - **17th century**: Armoires became status symbols in wealthy French households
    - **18th century**: The golden age of armoire craftsmanship, particularly in France
    - **19th century**: Mass production made wardrobes more accessible to middle-class homes
    
    Prior to the widespread adoption of built-in closets in the 20th century, these pieces were essential furniture in most bedrooms.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What types of wood are antique armoires typically made from?" >}}
    Antique armoires were crafted from various woods depending on the region, time period, and intended market:
    
    - **Oak**: Common in earlier pieces (16th-18th century), especially in Northern Europe
    - **Walnut**: Prized for French and Italian pieces from the 17th-19th centuries
    - **Mahogany**: Popular for higher-end British and American pieces from the late 18th century onward
    - **Pine**: Used for country and provincial pieces, especially in Scandinavia and rural France
    - **Rosewood and Exotic Woods**: Featured in luxury pieces, particularly during the 19th century
    - **Fruitwoods** (cherry, pear, apple): Often used in German and Alpine regions
    
    Many pieces also incorporate secondary woods for interior components, typically using more affordable or locally available species for non-visible parts.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my armoire is a valuable antique or a reproduction?" >}}
    Examine these key indicators to distinguish genuine antiques from reproductions:
    
    1. **Construction techniques**: Look for hand-cut dovetail joints, mortise and tenon joinery, and wood pegs instead of screws in older pieces.
    
    2. **Tool marks**: Hand planes leave distinctive patterns different from machine-finished surfaces. Look inside drawers and on back panels.
    
    3. **Materials**: Examine for old-growth timber with tight grain patterns and appropriate secondary woods.
    
    4. **Hardware**: Original hardware should show appropriate age and craftsmanship consistent with the period.
    
    5. **Wear patterns**: Authentic pieces show logical wear in areas of use (door edges, handles, floor contact points).
    
    6. **Finish**: Early pieces used shellac, oil, or wax finishes rather than modern polyurethane or lacquer.
    
    When in doubt, consult with a furniture specialist or antique appraiser who specializes in the relevant period.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What should I expect to pay for a good quality antique armoire?" >}}
    Price ranges vary significantly based on style, period, condition, and regional market factors:
    
    - **Entry-level antique armoires** (late 19th/early 20th century in good condition): $800-$2,500
    
    - **Mid-range quality pieces** (19th century in very good condition): $2,500-$8,000
    
    - **High-quality examples** (18th/early 19th century in excellent condition): $8,000-$25,000
    
    - **Museum-quality or rare pieces** (17th/18th century with provenance): $25,000-$100,000+
    
    French armoires typically command the highest prices, followed by Italian, then English pieces. American examples are often more affordable but have been appreciating in recent years.

  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Should I refinish my antique armoire to increase its value?" >}}
    Generally, refinishing an antique armoire will **decrease** rather than increase its value, particularly for older or higher-quality pieces. Collectors and dealers value original surfaces and patina that develop over centuries.
    
    Instead of refinishing, consider these less invasive approaches:
    
    1. **Gentle cleaning** with appropriate products
    2. **Wax treatment** to revive dried wood and enhance patina
    3. **Minor touch-ups** to address small scratches or chips
    4. **Professional conservation** for valuable pieces needing structural repairs
    
    If the finish is severely damaged or the piece is a lower-value item from the late 19th/early 20th century, refinishing might be more acceptable. When in doubt, consult with a furniture conservator before proceeding with any significant restoration.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What documentation should I keep with my antique armoire?" >}}
    Maintaining proper documentation enhances both historical significance and financial value:
    
    1. **Provenance records**: Any information about previous owners, locations, or historical context
    
    2. **Purchase documentation**: Original receipt, auction catalog listing, or bill of sale
    
    3. **Appraisal reports**: Professional valuations conducted by qualified experts
    
    4. **Restoration history**: Records of any conservation work, including before/after photos
    
    5. **Research findings**: Information about the style, period, or regional characteristics
    
    6. **Comparative examples**: Photos or auction results of similar pieces
    
    7. **Insurance documentation**: Coverage details and updated valuations
    
    Store this information securely, ideally both digitally and in physical form, and ensure it remains with the piece if ownership is transferred.
