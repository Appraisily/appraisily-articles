## History and Evolution of Garth's



  From modest beginnings to international prominence, Garth's journey spans nearly seven decades of growth and adaptation in the antiques and fine art market.



    Garth Oberlander establishes Garth's Auction Gallery in Delaware, Ohio, laying the foundation for what would become Ohio's oldest premier auction house.
  
    Tom and Carolyn Porter join the company, beginning a period of significant growth and expansion that would establish Garth's as a nationally recognized name in the auction world.
  
    Jeff and Amelia Jeffers take ownership, introducing new technology and marketing approaches while maintaining the company's commitment to integrity and customer service.
  
    Garth's acquires Ben J. Selkirk & Sons, Inc. (Selkirk Auctioneers & Appraisers), America's second-oldest auction brand, expanding their market reach and expertise.
  
    Significant changes in leadership, with Amelia Jeffers departing in 2017 and later establishing her own auction house at Garth's Barn in 2023, marking a new chapter in the company's evolution.
