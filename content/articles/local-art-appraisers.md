            There are several situations where having your artwork
            professionally appraised is essential: 1) Insurance Coverage: Most
            insurance companies require professional appraisals to properly
            insure valuable artwork. 2) Estate Planning: Accurate valuations are
            crucial for dividing assets, estate tax preparation, and charitable
            donations. 3) Buying or Selling: Whether you're considering a
            purchase or planning to sell, knowing the fair market value helps
            ensure you're making a sound decision. 4) Donations: For tax
            deduction purposes when donating art to museums or charitable
            organizations. 5) Divorce Settlements: Art collections often need to
            be valued for equitable distribution. 6) Authentication: To verify
            the authenticity and provenance of a piece.

        name: What types of art appraisals are available?

          '@type': Answer
          text: >-
            Art appraisals aren't one-size-fits-all. The type of appraisal you
            need depends on your specific situation: 1) Insurance Appraisal:
            Determines replacement value if artwork is damaged, stolen, or
            destroyed. This typically reflects retail replacement cost, which is
            often higher than fair market value. 2) Fair Market Value Appraisal:
            Estimates what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller when
            neither is under pressure to complete the transaction. Common for
            tax purposes, donations, and estate planning.

  Knowing what warning signs to look for can help you avoid unqualified appraisers or potential conflicts of interest.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

While most art appraisers operate ethically, be vigilant for these warning signs:

1. **Offering to buy or sell the artwork they're appraising** - This is a serious conflict of interest.

2. **Charging a percentage of the appraised value** - Ethical appraisers charge flat fees or hourly rates, not percentages.

3. **No formal credentials or professional affiliations** - Legitimate appraisers have verifiable qualifications.

4. **Unwillingness to provide references** - Reputable appraisers should be able to provide client references upon request.

5. **No written contract or unclear fee structure** - Professional appraisers provide clear agreements before beginning work.

6. **Providing verbal appraisals only** - For insurance, tax, or legal purposes, you need comprehensive written documentation.

7. **Quick "on-the-spot" valuations without research** - Accurate appraisals require thorough market research and analysis.

8. **No adherence to USPAP standards** - This is the industry benchmark for professional appraisal practices.

9. **Unwillingness to explain their methodology** - Transparent appraisers can explain how they arrived at their valuations.

10. **Guaranteeing specific appraisal values before examining the artwork** - No ethical appraiser can determine value without proper examination and research.
