{{< content-modules/section-header title="Introduction to Vintage PING Putters" level="2" >}}
PING putters, particularly vintage models, have become highly collectible items among golf enthusiasts and collectors. Created by engineering visionary Karsten Solheim beginning in the late 1950s, these putters revolutionized golf club design with their innovative engineering and distinctive sound - the "ping" that gave the company its name. Today, certain vintage PING putters command impressive prices in the collector's market, with some rare models valued at over $1,000.

{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Manufacturing Location and Era

The production location is perhaps the most critical value factor for vintage PING putters:

1. **Redwood City Models (1967-1969)**: These earliest production models, made in California before PING moved to Arizona, are the most valuable vintage PING putters. Identified by "Redwood City, Cal." stamping, these rare putters typically start at $1,000 in good condition.

2. **Scottsdale with ZIP Code (1969-1973)**: Early Scottsdale-produced putters featuring the "Scottsdale, AZ 85282" marking are highly collectible, with values often exceeding $100 and reaching several hundred dollars for desirable models in excellent condition.

3. **Scottsdale without ZIP Code (1973-1986)**: Later Scottsdale models without the ZIP code are less valuable but still collectible, typically ranging from $40-100 depending on condition and model.

### Materials and Special Editions

**Beryllium Copper Models**: PING putters made from beryllium copper (BeCu) command premium prices. These clubs offer a softer feel and develop a distinctive patina over time. Beryllium copper PING putters can sell for several hundred to over a thousand dollars depending on model and condition.

**Manganese Bronze**: The material Karsten Solheim chose for his earliest models - Manganese Bronze - helped define the PING putter. These early bronze putters often command higher prices due to their historical significance.

### Model Type

Different PING putter models vary significantly in collectibility and value:

- **Anser Series**: The most iconic PING putters, especially early versions, are highly sought after
- **1-A**: The original PING putter model has significant historical value
- **Zing**: Popular models with moderate collector value
- **My Day**: Distinctive design with dedicated collector following
- **Pal**: Early blade-style putters with good collector interest

{{< content-modules/section-header title="How to Identify Valuable PING Putters" level="2" >}}
Knowing how to properly identify vintage PING putters is essential for determining their potential value. Several key markers and characteristics can help you identify whether your PING putter might be a valuable collector's item.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Close-up of PING putter showing serial number location and manufacturing stamps](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/old-ping-putter-values/old-ping-putter-values-image-3_q8Xa9Jck_5.png)

### Serial Numbers and Markings

PING putter serial numbers can typically be found in one of several locations:
- On the face of the putter
- On the hosel (where the shaft enters the clubhead)
- On the heel of the putter

According to PING's official information, "putter serial numbers [are located] on the face, hosel or heel." These serial numbers can help determine the production date and authenticity of your putter.

### Address and Location Stamps

The location stamp is the most critical identifier for determining a PING putter's age and potential value:

- **Redwood City, California**: The earliest and most valuable putters (1967-1969)
- **Scottsdale, AZ 85282**: Early Scottsdale era putters with ZIP code (1969-1973)
- **Scottsdale, Arizona**: Later Scottsdale putters without ZIP code (1973-1986)
- **Phoenix, Arizona**: More recent production with lower collector value

### Color Dots and Their Meaning

PING putters often feature colored dots that indicate the lie angle:
- **Green Dot**: 2° upright lie angle
- **Orange Dot**: 2° flat lie angle
- Other colors represent different lie angles according to PING's color-coding system

While the colored dots primarily indicate fitting specifications rather than directly affecting value, original and correct color coding can be important to collectors seeking authentic examples.

### Golf Forums and Collector Communities

1. **GolfWRX Forums**: This popular golf forum has an active buy/sell section where knowledgeable collectors frequently look for vintage PING putters. The audience understands fair value, and there's typically less competition than on eBay.

- Original finish and patina
- No repairs, reshafting, or modifications

### Where to Find Vintage PING Putters

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Vintage PING Putter Values" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where is the serial number on a PING putter?" >}}
    Serial numbers for PING putters can be found in one of several locations: on the face of the putter, on the hosel (where the shaft enters the clubhead), or on the heel of the putter. These serial numbers can help determine the production date and authenticity of your putter.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What are old PING putters made of?" >}}
    The earliest PING putters were crafted from manganese bronze, which was Karsten Solheim's material of choice for its feel and quality. This material naturally tarnishes with age, creating a distinctive patina that many collectors appreciate. Later models were made from various materials including stainless steel, beryllium copper (which are highly valued), and modern alloys. The beryllium copper models are particularly sought after for their soft feel and distinctive appearance.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a Scottsdale PING putter worth?" >}}
    Scottsdale PING putters vary in value depending on whether they include the ZIP code in their stamp. Early Scottsdale putters with the "Scottsdale, AZ 85282" marking (made between 1969-1973) typically sell for $150-500 depending on model and condition. Later Scottsdale putters without the ZIP code (1973-1986) generally sell for $50-120. Condition, model type, and original components all affect the final value.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What does a green dot mean on a PING putter?" >}}
    The colored dots on PING putters indicate the lie angle of the club, which is part of PING's custom fitting system. A green dot specifically indicates that the putter has a lie angle that is 2° upright from standard. Orange dots indicate a 2° flat lie angle. While these dots primarily relate to fitting specifications rather than directly affecting collector value, having the original and correct color coding can be important to collectors seeking authentic examples.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell how old my PING putter is?" >}}
    The best way to determine the age of your PING putter is by examining the address stamp on the club:
    
    - "Redwood City, Cal." indicates 1967-1969 production
    - "Scottsdale, AZ 85282" indicates 1969-1973 production
    - "Scottsdale, Arizona" without ZIP code indicates 1973-1986 production
    - "Phoenix, Arizona" indicates more recent production
    
    The serial number can also help determine age, though PING does not publicly share their serial number dating system. For definitive identification, you can contact PING's customer service with your serial number.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Are PING Anser putters valuable?" >}}
    Yes, PING Anser putters can be quite valuable, especially older models. The value hierarchy generally follows:
    
    1. Redwood City Anser putters ($1,000-3,000+)
    2. Beryllium copper Anser models ($200-1,000+)
    3. Early Scottsdale Anser with ZIP code ($150-500)
    4. Later Scottsdale Anser without ZIP code ($50-120)
    5. Modern Anser reproductions ($20-65)
    
    Condition, originality, and provenance can significantly affect these values.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I sell my vintage PING putter?" >}}
    To sell a vintage PING putter, first accurately identify the model and era to establish its potential value. For maximum value, consider specialized golf marketplaces like the GolfWRX forum, eBay with detailed descriptions and quality photos, or specialty golf retailers like 2nd Swing Golf. For rare models like Redwood City putters or beryllium copper versions, consider auction houses or specialty golf auctions that attract serious collectors willing to pay premium prices.
