## Introduction to the 1919 Lincoln Wheat Penny

The 1919 Lincoln wheat penny represents an important piece of early 20th-century American numismatic history. Now over a century old, these small copper coins carry not just monetary value, but historical significance as well. Whether you've discovered one in an old coin jar, inherited a collection, or are looking to expand your numismatic portfolio, understanding what makes these pennies valuable is essential.

![1919 Lincoln Wheat Penny obverse showing Lincoln's profile](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-penny-from-1919-worth/how-much-is-a-penny-from-1919-worth-image-1_q9NUzQah6.png)

Designed by Victor D. Brenner and first introduced in 1909 to commemorate Abraham Lincoln's centennial birthday, these pennies featured Lincoln's profile on the obverse (front) and two wheat stalks on the reverse â€“ earning them the nickname "wheat pennies" or "wheaties." By 1919, the Lincoln cent was well-established in American commerce, with millions being produced across three different mints.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore exactly how much your 1919 penny might be worth today, examining the factors that affect its value, highlighting rare varieties and errors, and providing current market prices to help you determine if you're holding onto a common specimen or a valuable numismatic treasure.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="The Three Varieties of 1919 Wheat Pennies" level="2" >}}
1919 wheat pennies were minted at three different locations, each imparting its own mark (or lack thereof) on the coins. Understanding which mint produced your penny is the first step in determining its value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The U.S. Mint produced Lincoln cents at three facilities in 1919, resulting in three distinct varieties that collectors recognize today:

1. **1919 (Philadelphia)** - No mint mark, with 392,021,000 produced
2. **1919-D (Denver)** - "D" mint mark, with 57,154,000 produced
3. **1919-S (San Francisco)** - "S" mint mark, with 139,760,000 produced

The mint mark, when present, can be found on the obverse (front) of the coin, just below the date. Philadelphia-minted pennies have no mint mark at all, which is standard for many coins produced at this facility during this period.

![1919 Wheat Penny showing the mint mark location under the date](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-penny-from-1919-worth/how-much-is-a-penny-from-1919-worth-image-2_ZrVsJuDyl.png)

The mintage numbers clearly show that the Philadelphia mint produced the vast majority of 1919 pennies, making them the most common. The Denver mint produced the fewest, which generally makes the 1919-D penny the scarcest of the three varieties. This relative scarcity directly impacts the coin's value, with rarer variants typically commanding higher prices in the collector's market.

{{< data-modules/stats-highlight title="1919 Penny Production Statistics" columns="3" / / />}}

| Mint Location | Mint Mark | Mintage | Relative Rarity |
|---------------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Philadelphia  | None      | 392,021,000 | Common      |
| Denver        | D         | 57,154,000  | Scarcer     |
| San Francisco | S         | 139,760,000 | Less Common |

Understanding which variety you have is the crucial first step in determining your 1919 penny's value.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors Affecting 1919 Penny Value" level="2" >}}
The worth of a 1919 wheat penny is determined by several key factors, with condition and mint mark being the most significant influences on market value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Several factors combine to determine the value of your 1919 wheat penny:

### Mint Mark

As discussed above, the mint mark is a primary value determinant. Generally, the value hierarchy is:

1. **1919-D** - Usually the most valuable due to lower mintage
2. **1919-S** - Typically second in value
3. **1919 (No mint mark)** - Usually the least valuable due to high mintage

### Condition (Grade)

The preservation state of your coin dramatically affects its value. Numismatists use a standardized grading scale:

* **Circulated Grades**: About Good (AG-3), Good (G-4), Very Good (VG-8), Fine (F-12), Very Fine (VF-20, VF-30), Extremely Fine (EF-40, EF-45)
* **Uncirculated Grades**: About Uncirculated (AU-50, AU-55, AU-58), Mint State (MS-60 through MS-70)

![1919 wheat penny in Extremely Fine condition showing moderate wear](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-penny-from-1919-worth/how-much-is-a-penny-from-1919-worth-image-3_EGkl1Gklt.png)

A 1919 penny in poor condition might be worth only slightly more than face value, while one in pristine uncirculated condition could be worth many times more.

### Coloration

Lincoln cents are classified by their coloration:

* **Red (RD)** - Original mint luster with 95%+ original red copper color
* **Red-Brown (RB)** - Mixture of red and brown coloration
* **Brown (BN)** - Predominantly brown appearance

Red specimens command the highest prices, followed by red-brown, with brown examples being the least valuable.

### Errors and Varieties

Coins with striking errors or recognized die varieties can be worth significantly more than their standard counterparts. Examples include:

* Double dies
* Off-center strikes
* Repunched mint marks
* Die breaks and cracks

### Professional Certification

Coins authenticated and graded by professional services like PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) or NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation) often sell for premium prices due to the confidence they provide to buyers.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1919 (Philadelphia) Penny Value" level="2" >}}
The 1919 Philadelphia penny (with no mint mark) is the most common of the three varieties, making it generally the most affordable for collectors.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The 1919 penny without a mint mark was produced at the Philadelphia Mint with a substantial mintage of 392,021,000 coins. This large production run makes it relatively common, even after a century.

For circulated 1919 Philadelphia pennies in average condition, expect values of just a few dollars. However, well-preserved uncirculated examples, especially those with original red coloration, can command significant premiums. The value increases dramatically for gems in grades MS-65 and above, where finding specimens becomes increasingly difficult.

According to auction records, the highest prices paid for 1919 Philadelphia pennies have been for perfect red specimens in MS-67 or better, with some exceptional examples selling for over $2,000.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1919-D (Denver) Penny Value" level="2" >}}
With the lowest mintage of the three varieties, 1919-D pennies are generally the most valuable in the series, especially in higher grades.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The 1919-D penny, minted in Denver, had a production of 57,154,000 coinsâ€”substantially lower than the Philadelphia or San Francisco issues. This relative scarcity makes the 1919-D penny more valuable across all grade levels.

![1919-D Wheat Penny showing the D mint mark under the date](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-penny-from-1919-worth/how-much-is-a-penny-from-1919-worth-image-4_Hbd5LyXuj.png)

The Denver Mint pennies from this era often suffer from weaker strikes compared to those from other mints, making well-struck examples particularly desirable to collectors.

Even in lower circulated grades, 1919-D pennies command a premium over their Philadelphia counterparts. The value differential becomes particularly noticeable in uncirculated grades, where the scarcity of well-preserved examples becomes apparent.

High-grade 1919-D pennies are rare treasures for collectors, with MS-65 and above examples bringing four-figure prices. Red specimens in MS-67 have sold for well over $10,000 at major auctions, representing some of the most valuable wheat cents from this era.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="1919-S (San Francisco) Penny Value" level="2" >}}
San Francisco pennies from 1919 occupy the middle ground in terms of both mintage and value, with some exceptional specimens bringing premium prices.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The San Francisco Mint produced 139,760,000 pennies in 1919, placing its mintage between the high-production Philadelphia and lower-production Denver facilities.

Like many San Francisco coins from this era, 1919-S pennies often experienced weaker strikes and may show less detail than their Philadelphia counterparts, even in similar grades. Well-struck examples with full details command significant premiums.

In circulated grades, 1919-S pennies are generally worth more than their Philadelphia counterparts but less than Denver examples. The price gap widens considerably in uncirculated grades, where the scarcity of well-preserved 1919-S pennies becomes evident.

Premium-quality 1919-S pennies in MS-65 or better are quite rare, with red specimens commanding four-figure prices. According to NGC, the highest grade for 1919-S pennies they've certified is MS-67, with examples in this grade selling for well over $5,000.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Valuable 1919 Penny Errors and Varieties" level="2" >}}
While most 1919 pennies follow standard designs, error coins with minting mistakes can be significantly more valuable to collectors.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

Error coins represent mistakes in the minting process that create unique, often one-of-a-kind specimens that collectors prize. Here are some of the most valuable 1919 penny errors to watch for:

### Double Die Errors

Double die errors occur when the die used to strike the coin receives multiple impressions during its creation, resulting in a doubled appearance of design elements. For 1919 pennies, look for doubling in:

* The date
* The word LIBERTY
* Lincoln's features
* The wheat ears and lettering on the reverse

Depending on the prominence of the doubling and the overall condition of the coin, double die 1919 pennies can sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

### Off-Center Strikes

When a planchet (blank coin) is not properly centered during striking, the result is an off-center coin. These errors show part of the design, with a blank area where the die didn't strike.

* 10-15% off-center: $25-$75
* 20-50% off-center: $75-$200
* 50%+ off-center (with full date visible): $200-$400+

### Die Cracks and Breaks

As dies age and wear, they can develop cracks that appear as raised lines on the finished coins. Major die breaks can create dramatic varieties like the "cud" error (a raised blob of metal at the rim).

Values for die cracks vary widely depending on size, location, and prominence:
* Minor die cracks: $5-$20 premium
* Major die cracks/breaks: $50-$150+ premium

![1919 Wheat Penny showing a significant die crack error](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-a-penny-from-1919-worth/how-much-is-a-penny-from-1919-worth-image-5_vS4ygLS9z.png)

### Lamination Errors

Lamination errors occur when the metal planchet contains impurities that cause layers of the coin to peel or separate. These can appear as flaking, peeling, or missing sections of the coin surface.

Depending on the size and location of the lamination error, these coins can sell for $20-$200+ over standard values.

### Repunched Mint Marks

On 1919-D and 1919-S pennies, look for signs that the mint mark was punched multiple times, often slightly offset. These varieties show the D or S appearing to be doubled or overlapping.

Repunched mint marks typically add $20-$100+ to the coin's value, depending on the prominence of the error and the coin's condition.

### Clipped Planchets

Clipped planchet errors occur when the blank coin disc is incompletely punched from the metal strip, resulting in a coin with a missing section, often appearing as a curved cut-out from the edge.

Values range from $15-$100+ depending on the size and type of clip.

### Wrong Planchet Errors

Extremely rare are 1919 cents struck on planchets intended for other denominations (like nickels or dimes) or foreign coins. These dramatic errors can bring thousands of dollars from specialist collectors.

If you suspect you have a valuable error coin, consider having it authenticated by a professional grading service like PCGS or NGC to confirm its legitimacy and establish its value.

### Where to Buy 1919 Wheat Pennies

If you're looking to add 1919 pennies to your collection, several reliable sources exist:

1. **Coin Dealers** - Established numismatic dealers often have inventories of wheat pennies in various grades. They typically charge a premium but offer expertise and often stand behind their sales.

2. **Online Marketplaces** - eBay, Heritage Auctions, and other online platforms list numerous 1919 pennies at various price points. Exercise caution and favor sellers with strong feedback ratings and return policies.

3. **Coin Shows** - These events bring together dealers and collectors, allowing you to examine coins in person before purchasing. Many experts attend these shows, providing access to knowledge and a wide selection.

4. **Auction Houses** - Major auction houses like Stack's Bowers and Heritage often include 1919 pennies in their sales, particularly for higher-grade examples. These venues typically represent the upper end of the market.

5. **Coin Clubs** - Local and national numismatic clubs often hold member auctions or have members willing to sell from their collections, sometimes at more reasonable prices than retail.

### Where to Sell 1919 Wheat Pennies

When you're ready to sell, consider these options:

1. **Direct to Dealers** - Coin shops and dealers will purchase 1919 pennies, though typically at wholesale prices (60-80% of retail value).

2. **Online Platforms** - eBay and similar sites allow you to reach a wide audience, potentially achieving retail prices, though fees and shipping cut into profits.

3. **Coin Shows** - Setting up as a seller or working with a dealer at a show can help you find buyers willing to pay fair market prices.

4. **Auction Consignment** - For valuable specimens (generally $500+), consigning to a major auction house might yield the best results despite their commissions.

5. **Collector Forums** - Websites like CoinTalk and the PCGS/NGC forums have marketplace sections where you can connect with buyers, often with lower fees than commercial platforms.

### Authentication and Grading

For 1919 pennies valued at $100 or more, professional authentication and grading is strongly recommended:

1. **Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS)** - One of the most respected grading services, with 1919 pennies in their holders typically commanding premium prices.

2. **Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC)** - Another highly regarded service that encapsulates coins in tamper-evident holders with assigned grades.

3. **ANACS** - The oldest grading service, generally recognized though typically commanding slightly lower premiums than PCGS or NGC.

The cost for grading services typically ranges from $20-$50 per coin depending on the service, membership status, and declared value. While this might seem high for lower-value coins, the authentication and potential grade increase can often more than offset the cost for better specimens.

### Avoiding Counterfeit and Altered Coins

Be aware that counterfeit and artificially altered coins exist in the market:

* **Altered Mint Marks** - Adding a "D" or "S" to a common Philadelphia coin
* **Artificial Red Color** - Chemical treatments used to simulate mint red luster
* **Cleaned Coins** - Improperly cleaned coins that may initially appear more attractive but have reduced collector value
* **Outright Counterfeits** - Modern reproductions of rare dates and varieties

Working with reputable dealers and using authentication services for valuable purchases is the best protection against such fraudulent items.

Proper storage and handling are crucial to preserving both the condition and value of your century-old Lincoln cents.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

To maintain the condition and value of your 1919 wheat pennies, follow these best practices:

### Proper Handling

1. **Always hold coins by their edges** - Fingerprints contain oils and acids that can damage coin surfaces, particularly on copper coins like wheat pennies.

2. **Use cotton gloves when possible** - This prevents direct skin contact with the coin surface.

3. **Work over a soft surface** - Examine coins over a towel or soft pad to prevent damage if dropped.

4. **Never clean your coins** - Even gentle cleaning can remove the original surfaces and patina, significantly reducing collector value.

### Storage Options

1. **Coin Flips** - Inexpensive plastic or mylar holders suitable for individual coins. Choose non-PVC, archival-quality flips to prevent chemical damage.

2. **2x2 Cardboard Holders** - Paper/cardboard holders with mylar windows, secured by staples. These are affordable and suitable for long-term storage.

3. **Coin Albums** - Specialized albums for Lincoln cents provide convenient organization and display while offering protection.

4. **Certified Slabs** - PCGS, NGC, and other grading services encapsulate coins in tamper-evident plastic holders that provide excellent protection.

5. **Safe Deposit Boxes** - For valuable specimens, consider bank storage for additional security.

### Environmental Factors

1. **Avoid Extreme Temperatures** - Heat and cold cycles can damage coins or their holders.

2. **Control Humidity** - Excessive moisture can promote corrosion, particularly on copper coins like wheat pennies.

3. **Avoid Direct Sunlight** - UV exposure can cause color changes and damage to both coins and holders.

4. **Prevent Chemical Exposure** - Keep coins away from household chemicals, cleaning products, and air pollutants.

### Insurance Considerations

For collections containing valuable 1919 pennies:

1. **Document Your Collection** - Maintain photographs and detailed descriptions of each coin.

2. **Obtain Appraisals** - Professional appraisals provide documentation for insurance purposes.

3. **Specialized Insurance** - Consider collector insurance policies that specifically cover numismatic items, which typical homeowner's policies may exclude or limit.

By following these guidelines, you'll help ensure that your 1919 wheat pennies maintain their condition and value for years to come, preserving these historical artifacts for future generations.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Frequently Asked Questions About 1919 Wheat Pennies" id="faq-section" >}}
{{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my 1919 penny is valuable?" >}}
The most valuable 1919 pennies will have:
- A mint mark (D or S) under the date
- Excellent preservation with minimal wear
- Original surfaces (never cleaned)
- Red or red-brown color
- Possible error features or die varieties

The Denver (D) mint mark generally indicates the most valuable variety, especially in uncirculated condition. Professional grading is recommended for any 1919 penny you believe is in exceptional condition.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where is the mint mark on a 1919 penny?" >}}
On 1919 wheat pennies, the mint mark (when present) is located on the obverse (front) side of the coin, directly below the date. Look for a small "D" (Denver) or "S" (San Francisco) beneath the 9 in 1919. Philadelphia-minted pennies have no mint mark at all, which is standard for this mint during this period.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a 1919 penny with no mint mark worth?" >}}
A 1919 penny with no mint mark (from Philadelphia) typically ranges in value from:
- $0.50-$2.00 in worn circulated condition
- $3.00-$12.00 in better circulated grades (VF to AU)
- $15.00-$100.00 in uncirculated brown condition
- $40.00-$250.00 in uncirculated red-brown to red condition
- $1,000+ for pristine gem red specimens in MS-67 or better

Values can be higher for coins with exceptional eye appeal or certified by PCGS or NGC.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="What makes a 1919 penny rare or valuable?" >}}
Several factors can make a 1919 penny particularly valuable:
- Denver (D) or San Francisco (S) mint marks
- Uncirculated condition with original mint luster
- Red or red-brown color (rather than brown)
- Sharp strike with full details
- Notable errors like double dies or off-center strikes
- Professionally certified high grades (MS-65 or above)

The rarest 1919 pennies are those in pristine, gem uncirculated condition (MS-67+) with full red color, especially from the Denver mint.

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="Should I clean my 1919 wheat penny to improve its appearance?" >}}
No, you should never clean your 1919 wheat penny (or any collectible coin). Cleaning:
- Removes the original surfaces and patina
- Creates unnatural luster that experts can easily detect
- Significantly reduces the coin's collector value
- Can cause long-term damage to the metal

Even circulated, darkened pennies are more valuable with their original surfaces intact than if they've been cleaned. What may appear to be an improvement to an untrained eye is actually permanent damage in the numismatic market.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my 1919 penny is uncirculated?" >}}
An uncirculated (mint state) 1919 penny will show:
- No wear on the high points (Lincoln's hair, cheek, and jaw)
- Original mint luster (though possibly darkened with age)
- No evidence of circulation damage like scratches or dings
- Sharp details throughout the design

The easiest areas to check for wear are Lincoln's cheek and jaw, as well as the highest points of his hair. Any flattening or smoothing of these areas indicates the coin has circulated. Uncirculated coins will have a distinct cartwheel luster when tilted under light, though this may be obscured on coins that have naturally toned brown.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="Is it worth getting my 1919 penny professionally graded?" >}}
Professional grading is worth considering for:
- Any 1919-D or 1919-S in Extremely Fine (EF-40) or better condition
- Any 1919 (Philadelphia) in About Uncirculated (AU) or better condition
- Any 1919 penny with apparent errors or varieties
- Any 1919 penny that appears to have original red or red-brown color

Given that grading typically costs $20-$50 per coin, it's generally not economical for common circulated examples worth less than $50. However, for better specimens, the authentication, precise grade assignment, and protective holder can increase marketability and potentially value enough to offset the cost.
{{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}

{{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much copper is in a 1919 wheat penny?" >}}
A 1919 wheat penny is composed of 95% copper and 5% zinc and tin (bronze). The coin weighs 3.11 grams, meaning it contains approximately 2.95 grams of copper. At current metal prices, the intrinsic copper value is substantially higher than the face value of one cent, though still lower than the numismatic (collector) value in most cases.

Note that it's illegal to melt U.S. pennies for their copper content, so the metal value is primarily of academic interest.

## Conclusion

The 1919 Lincoln wheat penny represents a tangible connection to American history from over a century ago. While most examples found in circulation today are worth a modest premium over face value, specimens in exceptional condition or with mint marks can be worth significantly more to collectors.

The most valuable 1919 pennies are those with the "D" mint mark in uncirculated condition with original red color, some of which have sold for thousands of dollars at auction. However, even common Philadelphia-minted examples in well-preserved condition can command respectable premiums in today's numismatic market.

For collectors, the 1919 wheat penny offers an accessible entry point to historical coin collecting, with examples available at nearly every price point from a few dollars to several thousand. These centenarian coins continue to grow in popularity as they move further into history, ensuring their place in American numismatic interest for generations to come.

Whether you're looking to determine the value of a single 1919 penny found in pocket change or building a complete collection of early Lincoln cents, understanding the factors that influence these coins' valuesâ€”mint marks, condition, color, and errorsâ€”will help you make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding these small but significant pieces of American coinage history.
