        text: >-
          While most Bicentennial quarters in circulation are worth their face
          value of 25 cents, certain varieties, mint marks, errors, and
          exceptional conditions can significantly increase their value—with the
          rarest examples fetching up to $19,000.

        text: >-
          The US Mint began producing Bicentennial quarters with the dual date
          1776-1976 in 1975, temporarily suspending the production of standard
          1975 quarters. Production continued through 1976, with over 1.6
          billion Bicentennial quarters eventually released into circulation.

While most Bicentennial quarters in circulation are worth their face value of 25 cents, certain varieties, mint marks, errors, and exceptional conditions can significantly increase their value—with the rarest examples fetching up to $19,000. This comprehensive guide will help you understand what makes these quarters valuable and how to identify potential treasures in your collection.

The distinct design of the Bicentennial quarter is what makes it immediately recognizable in circulation even today. Understanding these design elements is essential for collectors and can help in identifying potential valuable variants.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Close-up of the reverse design of a Bicentennial quarter showing the drummer boy](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-the-bicentennial-quarter-worth/how-much-is-the-bicentennial-quarter-worth-image-2_KjYoaKXjX.png)

The obverse (front) of the Bicentennial quarter maintains the traditional portrait of George Washington designed by John Flanagan, but with the dual date "1776-1976" replacing the standard single year.

The reverse (back) features Jack L. Ahr's Colonial drummer boy design, which won the design competition. It includes:
- A Colonial drummer facing left
- 13 stars representing the original colonies
- The inscription "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" along the top
- "QUARTER DOLLAR" along the bottom
- The national motto "E PLURIBUS UNUM" above the drummer

Mint marks on Bicentennial quarters can be found on the obverse side, just below Washington's hair tie:
- No mint mark: Philadelphia Mint
- "D": Denver Mint
- "S": San Francisco Mint (primarily for collector sets)

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Bicentennial Quarter Types and Values" level="2" >}}
Not all Bicentennial quarters are created equal. Different mints, compositions, and production methods created several distinct types that vary significantly in their current market value.

### Regular Clad Issues

The vast majority of Bicentennial quarters found in circulation are what collectors call "clad" coins—composed of copper-nickel outer layers bonded to a pure copper core. These were minted in enormous quantities:

- Philadelphia Mint (no mint mark): 809,784,016 coins
- Denver Mint (D mint mark): 860,118,839 coins

In circulated condition, these regular clad quarters are typically worth only their face value of 25 cents. Even in uncirculated condition (MS63), they typically sell for just $1-$3, though gem uncirculated specimens (MS65 or better) can fetch $5-$20.

### Silver Varieties

The San Francisco Mint produced special 40% silver versions for collectors:

- Uncirculated Silver: 4,908,319 coins
- Proof Silver: 4,149,730 coins

These silver versions were not released into circulation but were sold directly to collectors in special Mint sets. Today, the 40% silver Bicentennial quarters have a value of:

- $5-$10 in circulated condition
- $15-$30 in average uncirculated condition
- $50-$300+ for high-grade specimens (MS69 or PR69)

A 1976-S silver proof Bicentennial quarter in perfect MS70 or PR70 condition can sell for $1,000 or more to the right collector.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Valuable Bicentennial Quarter Errors" level="2" >}}
While standard Bicentennial quarters are common, certain error coins can be extremely valuable. These mistakes during the minting process created rare variants that collectors eagerly seek.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Example of a Bicentennial quarter with a double-die error showing doubled lettering](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-the-bicentennial-quarter-worth/how-much-is-the-bicentennial-quarter-worth-image-4_G7B2_gpvp.png)

### Double Die Errors

One of the most valuable Bicentennial quarter errors is the double die variety, where parts of the design appear doubled due to multiple impressions from the die during minting. The most prominent double die errors can be seen in:

- The lettering around the edge
- Washington's profile
- The drummer boy figure
- The stars on the reverse

Double die Bicentennial quarters in uncirculated condition can sell for $100-$300, with exceptional specimens reaching $1,000 or more.

### Off-Center Strikes

Off-center strikes occur when the coin blank is not properly centered during the striking process. Depending on the severity:

- 5-10% off-center: $25-$50
- 20-30% off-center: $100-$200
- 50% or more off-center (with date still visible): $300-$800+

### Missing Clad Layer

Some Bicentennial quarters were struck with a missing outer layer, exposing the copper core. These "missing clad layer" errors can be worth $100-$300 depending on the extent and condition of the error.

### Wrong Planchet Errors

In rare cases, Bicentennial quarters were struck on planchets (coin blanks) intended for other denominations:

- Struck on dime planchet: $300-$500
- Struck on nickel planchet: $400-$800
- Struck on penny planchet: $500-$1,000

### The $19,000+ Bicentennial Quarter

The most valuable Bicentennial quarter error reported was a coin struck on a silver planchet intended for a Canadian quarter. This extremely rare error coin sold for over $19,000 at auction, demonstrating how dramatically errors can increase a coin's value.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Identifying Silver Bicentennial Quarters" level="2" >}}
Silver Bicentennial quarters are among the most valuable regular issues, but they can be difficult to distinguish from regular clad quarters without knowing what to look for.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

The most reliable ways to identify a silver Bicentennial quarter include:

1. **Check the mint mark**: All silver Bicentennial quarters have an "S" mint mark from the San Francisco Mint. However, not all S-mint quarters are silver, as San Francisco also produced clad proof quarters.

2. **Look at the edge**: Silver Bicentennial quarters won't show the copper core visible on the edge of clad quarters. The edge of a silver quarter will have a solid silver-white appearance.

3. **Weigh the coin**: Silver Bicentennial quarters weigh approximately 5.75 grams, slightly more than the 5.67 grams of standard clad quarters.

4. **Check the packaging**: Most silver Bicentennial quarters were sold in special packaging as part of mint or proof sets. Finding one in original government packaging is a good indicator of its silver content.

5. **Use a magnet**: Neither silver nor clad quarters will stick to a magnet, but this test can help eliminate counterfeit coins made of steel or other magnetic metals.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Factors Affecting Bicentennial Quarter Value" level="2" >}}
Multiple factors determine how much a Bicentennial quarter is worth in today's market. Understanding these elements can help you better assess the potential value of coins in your collection.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

![Bicentennial quarter being examined with a magnifying glass to assess condition](https://ik.imagekit.io/appraisily/SEO/how-much-is-the-bicentennial-quarter-worth/how-much-is-the-bicentennial-quarter-worth-image-5_twr2hofZH.png)

### 1. Condition (Grade)

Coin condition is perhaps the most significant value factor for standard (non-error) Bicentennial quarters:

- **Circulated**: Shows wear from being used in commerce. Most circulated Bicentennial quarters are worth face value.
- **Uncirculated (MS60-MS64)**: No wear but may have contact marks, bag marks, or less-than-perfect luster.
- **Gem Uncirculated (MS65-MS69)**: Exceptional specimens with excellent luster and minimal imperfections.
- **Perfect (MS70)**: Theoretically flawless under 5x magnification. Extremely rare for Bicentennial quarters.

For proof coins, similar grades apply but are designated with "PR" or "PF" rather than "MS" (e.g., PR70 instead of MS70).

### 2. Mint Mark

As discussed earlier, the mint mark plays a crucial role in determining value:
- No mint mark (Philadelphia): Lowest premium
- D (Denver): Similar value to Philadelphia coins
- S (San Francisco): Highest premium, especially for silver versions

### 3. Composition

- Clad (copper-nickel): Standard composition, lowest value
- 40% Silver: Higher intrinsic metal value plus collector premium

### 4. Special Varieties and Errors

Errors and varieties dramatically increase value, with some rare Bicentennial quarter errors worth thousands of times face value.

### 5. Original Packaging

Bicentennial quarters still in original government packaging (mint sets, proof sets, or special commemorative packaging) often command higher prices than loose coins of the same grade.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Where to Sell Valuable Bicentennial Quarters" level="2" >}}
If you believe you have a valuable Bicentennial quarter, several options exist for selling it to realize its full market value.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Professional Grading Services

For potentially valuable Bicentennial quarters, especially errors or high-grade specimens, professional grading is often worthwhile:

1. **PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service)**: www.pcgs.com
2. **NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation)**: www.ngccoin.com

These services authenticate, grade, and encapsulate your coin in a tamper-evident holder, often increasing its marketability and value.

### Selling Options

Once your valuable Bicentennial quarter has been authenticated and/or graded:

1. **Coin Dealers**: Local coin shops can offer immediate payment, though usually at wholesale prices.

2. **Coin Shows**: Larger coin shows attract numerous dealers, potentially resulting in competitive offers.

3. **Online Marketplaces**: 
   - eBay
   - Heritage Auctions (ha.com)
   - Great Collections (greatcollections.com)

4. **Collector Forums**: Sites like CoinTalk or the PCGS and NGC forums allow direct sales to collectors.

5. **Auction Houses**: For extremely valuable errors (like the $19,000 specimen), major auction houses may be appropriate.

{{< content-modules/section-header title="Collecting Bicentennial Quarters" level="2" >}}
Building a collection of Bicentennial quarters can be a rewarding hobby accessible to collectors of all budgets, from beginners to advanced numismatists.
{{< /content-modules/section-header >}}

### Basic Collection

A starter collection of Bicentennial quarters might include:
- Philadelphia (no mint mark) business strike
- Denver (D) business strike
- San Francisco (S) clad proof

This basic set can be assembled for under $10 and is a great entry point for new collectors.

### Intermediate Collection

An intermediate collector might expand to include:
- Philadelphia and Denver in uncirculated condition
- San Francisco clad proof
- San Francisco 40% silver uncirculated
- San Francisco 40% silver proof

This expanded set could cost $50-$100 depending on the grades.

### Advanced Collection

Serious collectors might pursue:
- High-grade examples (MS67+ or PR69+) of all varieties
- Original government packaging
- Notable error varieties
- Complete "year sets" with all denominations (quarter, half dollar, and dollar)

Such advanced collections can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars depending on the grades and rarities included.

{{< content-modules/faq title="Common Questions About Bicentennial Quarter Values" id="faq-section" >}}
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How do I know if my Bicentennial quarter is rare?" >}}
    To determine if your Bicentennial quarter might be rare and valuable:

    1. Check for the "S" mint mark below Washington's hair tie, which indicates a San Francisco Mint coin that could be silver.
    2. Examine the edge – a solid silver appearance (no copper showing) suggests a silver version.
    3. Look for errors like double dies, off-center strikes, or wrong planchets using a magnifying glass.
    4. Weigh the coin – silver versions weigh slightly more (5.75g) than standard clad quarters (5.67g).
    5. Assess the condition – uncirculated coins with no wear or marks are more valuable.

    Remember that most Bicentennial quarters in circulation are worth only face value unless they have one of these distinguishing characteristics.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a 1776 to 1976 D quarter worth today?" >}}
    A 1776-1976 D quarter (minted in Denver) in typical circulated condition is generally worth only its face value of 25 cents. In uncirculated condition (MS63), it might be worth $1-$3, while gem uncirculated specimens (MS65+) can fetch $5-$20.

    The "D" mint mark indicates the coin was made at the Denver Mint, which produced over 860 million Bicentennial quarters – making them quite common. However, if your Denver quarter has an error or is in exceptionally high grade (MS67 or better), it could be worth significantly more to collectors.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a Bicentennial quarter with no mint mark worth?" >}}
    A Bicentennial quarter with no mint mark (minted in Philadelphia) is typically worth only face value (25 cents) in circulated condition. In uncirculated condition, these quarters might sell for $1-$3, with premium examples in grades MS65 or higher bringing $5-$20.

    The absence of a mint mark indicates the coin was struck at the Philadelphia Mint, which produced over 809 million Bicentennial quarters. Like all Bicentennial quarters, however, error coins or those in exceptional condition can be worth substantially more to collectors.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Where is the mint mark on a Bicentennial quarter?" >}}
    The mint mark on a Bicentennial quarter can be found on the obverse (front) side of the coin, just below Washington's hair tie or ponytail. You'll need to look carefully as the mint mark is small:

    - No mint mark indicates the coin was made at the Philadelphia Mint
    - "D" indicates the Denver Mint
    - "S" indicates the San Francisco Mint

    San Francisco ("S") Bicentennial quarters are the most potentially valuable, particularly if they are 40% silver versions made specially for collectors.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How much is a 1776 to 1976 drummer boy quarter worth?" >}}
    All Bicentennial quarters feature the drummer boy design on the reverse (back), so this question refers to standard Bicentennial quarters. Their value depends on mint mark, composition, and condition:

    - Regular clad quarters (no mint mark or D) in circulated condition: Face value (25¢)
    - Uncirculated regular quarters: $1-$20 depending on grade
    - San Francisco (S) clad proofs: $3-$30 depending on grade
    - San Francisco (S) 40% silver versions: $5-$300+ depending on grade and type
    - Error varieties: $25 to $19,000+ depending on the error and condition

    The most valuable "drummer boy quarters" are those with significant minting errors or the highest possible grades (MS69/PR69 or better).
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="Can Bicentennial quarters be worth millions?" >}}
    Despite some online claims, there are no confirmed cases of Bicentennial quarters worth millions of dollars. The most valuable authenticated Bicentennial quarter error ever sold went for approximately $19,200 at auction – a coin struck on a silver planchet intended for a Canadian quarter.

    While this is an impressive premium over face value, it falls far short of "millions." Be skeptical of extreme value claims online, which are often clickbait or misinformation. The vast majority of Bicentennial quarters are worth only face value, with even most errors selling in the $50-$1,000 range.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="What Bicentennial quarter errors should I look for?" >}}
    The most valuable Bicentennial quarter errors to look for include:

    1. Double die errors: Look for doubling in the lettering, Washington's profile, or the drummer boy design
    2. Off-center strikes: Where the design is not centered on the coin
    3. Missing clad layer: Exposing the copper core partially or completely
    4. Wrong planchet errors: Struck on blanks intended for other denominations (will have incorrect size/weight)
    5. Die cracks and cuds: Raised lines or bumps caused by damaged dies
    6. Broadstrikes: Coins struck without collar, appearing larger and thinner than normal

    Use a magnifying glass for examination, and consider weighing suspicious coins, as many errors affect the standard weight of 5.67 grams.
  {{< /content-modules/faq-item >}}
  
  {{< content-modules/faq-item question="How can I tell if my Bicentennial quarter is silver?" >}}
    To determine if your Bicentennial quarter is silver:

    1. Check for the "S" mint mark below Washington's ponytail. All silver Bicentennial quarters were minted in San Francisco, though not all S-mint quarters are silver.
    
    2. Examine the edge of the coin. Silver quarters will have a solid silver-colored edge with no copper showing through. Regular clad quarters will show a copper stripe along the edge.
    
    3. Weigh the coin if possible. Silver Bicentennial quarters weigh approximately 5.75 grams, slightly more than the 5.67 grams of standard clad quarters.
    
    4. Consider the coin's origin. Silver quarters were only sold in special mint sets and proof sets, not released for circulation. Finding one in pocket change would be extremely unlikely.
    
    If you're still unsure, consider having the coin professionally evaluated by a coin dealer or numismatic expert.
