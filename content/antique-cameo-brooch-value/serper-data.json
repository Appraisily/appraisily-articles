      "question": "How do I know if my cameo brooch is valuable?",
      "snippet": "The quality of paint and enamel used by vintage artisans is usually more durable than that used by counterfeit manufacturers nowadays. Real cameos were made to last, so the design should be fairly intact. This is also an indication of value. Scratched designs cause the value of the cameo to decrease.",

      "snippet": "These rare facing cameos can be worth a lot of money. Women are used most often as subject matter in a cameo, but a man is worth more.

      "question": "How can I tell how old my cameo is?",
      "snippet": "One method of dating portrait cameos is to look at the shape of the nose. In general, the straight, Roman nose is indicative of pieces from the earlier half of the 19th Century. The Victorians preferred a slightly upturned nose, and as we move into the 1920's and beyond, the nose becomes even more sloped and curved.",
