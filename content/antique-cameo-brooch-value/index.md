Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive article on antique cameo brooch value. Let me start by breaking down each of the user's eight points to ensure I cover everything thoroughly. 

First, understanding what gives antique cameo brooches their value. From the search results, materials like shell, agate, and other stones play a big role. Also, craftsmanship and historical period are important. The user wants to know why they're valuable—probably their artistry, historical significance, and rarity. 

Next, the historical background. The sources mention cameos dating back to the 16th century, with shell becoming popular then. Victorian and Edwardian eras are significant, as seen in some examples. I should note how trends and materials evolved over time, maybe touch on how tourism in places like Pompeii influenced their popularity.

Types and variations would include materials (shell vs. hardstone), subjects (mythological figures, women, men), and settings (gold, silver). The search results have examples like lava cameos from the Victorian era and different mountings. Also, categories based on era, like Georgian vs. Victorian.

Factors determining value: material, craftsmanship, condition, subject matter, and provenance. The sources mention that shell cameos are less valuable than hardstone, and details like the hinge type (C-clasp) can indicate age. Also, the presence of precious metals or gems increases value. Rarity of the subject, like African American depictions or men, adds value too.

Identifying authenticity involves checking for transparency in shell cameos, looking for tool marks, and examining the setting. The hinge type and metal markings (like pinchbeck) can help date the piece. Also, UV light tests for plastic fakes.

Market trends: The search results show brooches are trending in 2025, which might affect demand. Auction data from LiveAuctioneers and examples like the $150,000 emerald brooch give current pricing benchmarks. Noticing that Edwardian pieces from 1910s are priced around $525, while high-end ones go up to six figures.

Where to buy/sell: Auction houses, specialized antique dealers like Eredi Jovon, online platforms. The user might need reputable sources, so mentioning specific vendors from the search results would help.

Care tips: Avoiding sunlight, proper storage, oiling shell cameos, and avoiding harsh cleaners. The sources emphasize using baby oil and soft cloths, not using jewelry cleaners.

I need to structure each section with headers, include specific examples like the emerald brooch or Elizabeth Taylor's bangle, and cite the relevant sources. Also, ensure that each section flows logically, covering all aspects the user requested. Make sure to use markdown for headers and lists, and cite sources properly after each relevant point. Check that all eight points are addressed with detailed information from the provided search results.

Antique cameo brooches represent a unique intersection of artistry, history, and craftsmanship, making their valuation a nuanced process. Below is a detailed analysis structured to address the complexities of their worth, historical context, and preservation.

## 1. **Understanding Antique Cameo Brooch Value**  
Antique cameo brooches derive value from their **material quality**, **historical significance**, **artistic detail**, and **rarity**. These pieces are prized for their hand-carved reliefs, often depicting mythological figures, historical personalities, or intricate scenes. High-value examples include a $150,000 emerald and diamond Art Nouveau brooch [9] and Elizabeth Taylor’s $98,000 diamond-and-enamel bangle [9]. Their importance lies in their dual role as wearable art and historical artifacts, reflecting cultural trends from the Renaissance to the Victorian era.

## 2. **Historical Evolution**  
- **16th–18th Century**: Early cameos were carved from stone (onyx, agate). Shell emerged as a cheaper alternative in the 16th century, popularized by Italian artisans [2].  
- **Victorian Era (1837–1901)**: Lavish gold settings and themes like mythology flourished. Lava-stone cameos became synonymous with this period [2][3].  
- **Edwardian Era (1901–1910)**: Delicate filigree and platinum/gold settings gained prominence, as seen in a 1910s 10k gold Artemis brooch priced at $525 [10].  
- **Modern Revivals**: Mid-20th-century pieces often mimic historical styles but lack age-related premiums [4].

## 3. **Types and Variations**  
| **Category**         | **Characteristics**                                                                 | **Examples**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Material**          | Shell (common), hardstone (agate, coral), lava (Victorian), precious stones (rare) | Shell cameos dominate mid-range markets; hardstone commands premiums [4][9]. |
| **Subject Matter**    | Women (common), men (rarer), African American figures (highest value), mythologies | A Roman-inspired hardstone brooch sold for $25,000 [9].                     |
| **Era**               | Georgian (intricate frames), Victorian (lava/gold), Edwardian (filigree)           | Edwardian 10k gold brooches with c-clasps [10].                             |
| **Mounting**          | Gold, pinchbeck (pre-1840), silver, enamel                                          | Pinchbeck settings indicate pre-1850 origins [2][4].                        |

## 4. **Key Valuation Factors**  
- **Material**: Hardstone (agate, coral) > shell > plastic. A hot needle test distinguishes plastic [4][14].  
- **Craftsmanship**: Hand-carved details (e.g., curls, floral borders) vs. machine-made uniformity. Laser-cut modern pieces often lack depth [1][11].  
- **Condition**: No cracks or repairs. Chips reduce value, even in antique pieces [1][8].  
- **Provenance**: Ownership by figures like Elizabeth Taylor added 30%+ to a bangle’s value [9].  
- **Rarity**: Forward-facing subjects, multi-layered metamorphic scenes, or African American depictions command premiums [1][9].  

---

## 5. **Authenticity Identification**  
- **Transparency Test**: Shell cameos show silhouettes under light; plastic fakes lack depth [14].  
- **Tool Marks**: Magnification reveals hand-carving irregularities vs. machine precision [14].  
- **Mounting Clues**:  
  - **C-clasp pins** (pre-1900s) vs. safety catches (20th century+) [2].  
  - Pinchbeck or 9k gold settings indicate pre-1854 origins [2][4].  
- **UV Light**: Plastic fluoresces; natural materials do not [14].  

---

## 6. **Market Trends (2025)**  
- **Demand Surge**: Brooches are a 2025 jewelry trend, elevating prices for wearable art [6].  
- **Auction Data**:  
  - Shell cameos: $50–$2,150 [13].  
  - Hardstone/historical pieces: $25,000–$150,000 [9].  
  - Edwardian examples: $500–$1,500 [10].  
- **Collector Preferences**: Art Nouveau motifs and intact provenance drive top bids [9].  

---

## 7. **Acquisition and Sale Channels**  
- **Auctions**: LiveAuctioneers and Heritage Auctions feature rare pieces (e.g., $36,250 opal brooches) [13].  
- **Specialized Dealers**: Venice’s Eredi Jovon offers curated 18th–19th-century cameos [5][7].  
- **Online Platforms**: Mae Jean Vintage and Solvang Antiques authenticate mid-range pieces [10][14].  

---

## 8. **Preservation Guidelines**  
- **Storage**: Use velvet-lined boxes; avoid cotton (dries shell) [8][15].  
- **Cleaning**: Soft brush with diluted Woolite; avoid commercial cleaners [8][12].  
- **Moisturizing**: Biannual mineral oil application prevents shell brittleness [8][15].  
- **Handling**: Never expose to direct sunlight or extreme temperatures [8][14].
