Okay, I need to write a comprehensive article on the value of antique rocking chairs. Let me start by breaking down the user's query into the eight specified aspects. 

First, understanding what makes an antique rocking chair valuable. From the search results, factors like age, craftsmanship, materials, and historical significance are key. For example, the Stickley rocking chair mentioned in source [1] can cost up to $3,000. Also, the Shaker ladder-back chair in [1] was appraised at $67,260, showing how design and maker affect value.

Next, historical background. Source [6] mentions rocking chairs appearing in England in 1725, with Michael Thonet's bentwood design in 1860. The Boston and Salem rockers from the 19th century (source [1]) are important historical types. I should connect the evolution of styles to their current values.

Types and variations: The user wants different categories. From the sources, there's Boston/Salem, Rustic, Windsor, Shaker, Bentwood, Wicker, and Platform rockers. Each has distinct features and values. For example, Windsor rockers vary from $100 to $700 (source [5]), while Shaker chairs can be extremely valuable (source [1]).

Determining factors: Materials (hardwoods vs. composites), construction techniques (handmade vs. machine), maker's marks, and provenance. Source [5] and [7] discuss nails and finishes as indicators of age. Condition is crucial; repairs can lower value (source [1]).

Identification: Look for manufacturer marks, wear patterns, and construction details. Source [7] mentions checking for shellac finishes pre-1860. Also, handmade joints vs. machine-made (source [5]).

Market trends: Source [13] talks about the market growth driven by ergonomic demand and interior design trends. Prices vary widely, from $50 for wicker to over $60k for rare pieces. Online platforms like Chairish (source [2]) and auctions (source [4]) are key marketplaces.

Buying/selling venues: Antique stores, online marketplaces (Chairish, Bidsquare), auctions, and estate sales. Source [3] mentions Mearto for appraisals. Restoration tips from source [9] about preserving finishes with shellac.

Care and maintenance: Avoid direct sunlight, use gentle cleaners, and professional restoration for significant damage. Source [9] advises against harsh chemicals to preserve original finishes.

I need to structure all this into sections with examples and citations. Make sure each section flows into the next, using headers properly. Include specific examples like the Shaker chair's high value and the Thonet bentwood design. Cite sources inline, like [1] for Stickley chairs and [6] for historical dates. Check that all eight aspects are covered thoroughly, using the provided search results for evidence. Avoid lists, use paragraphs, and maintain an academic tone. Ensure the conclusion synthesizes the info and maybe touches on future market trends from source [13]. Also, mention preservation's role in maintaining value, as in source [9].

## Historical Background and Development  

The rocking chair’s origins trace to 18th-century England, where stationary chairs were retrofitted with curved bases to create motion[6]. By the 1720s, Windsor chairs—characterized by spindle backs and carved crest rails—were adapted into rockers in colonial America, marking the beginning of specialized designs[1][6]. The 19th century saw innovations like Lambert Hitchcock’s Boston rocker, which featured stenciled floral motifs and maple construction, and Michael Thonet’s 1860 bentwood rocker, a lightweight design using steamed beech[1][6]. These advancements reflected societal shifts toward comfort and aesthetic refinement, with rocking chairs becoming staples in Victorian parlors and Adirondack lodges[1][12].  

The Industrial Revolution introduced machine-made components, but handcrafted pieces from artisans like the Shakers retained prestige. Shaker rocking chairs, known for minimalist ladder-back designs and cane seats, became symbols of utilitarian beauty, with one 19th-century example appraised at $67,260[1][5]. By the 1920s, folding rockers emerged for portability, while mid-century modernists like Sam Maloof reimagined the form with ergonomic contours[6][13]. This historical progression underscores how technological and cultural changes shaped the rocking chair’s evolution and enduring appeal.

## Types and Variations  

### 1. **Boston/Salem Rockers**  
Originating in 19th-century New England, these feature curved seats, bowed backs, and decorative stenciling. Valued between $295 and $750, they are distinguished by maple frames and pine seats[1][14].  

### 2. **Windsor Rockers**  
Derived from 18th-century British garden chairs, Windsor rockers use spindle backs and turned legs. Prices range from $100 for basic models to $700 for high-end versions[5][12].  

### 3. **Shaker Rockers**  
Crafted by Shaker communities, these emphasize simplicity with ladder-back designs and cane seats. Rare examples, such as a maple chair from Union Village, Ohio, fetch over $60,000[1][5].  

### 4. **Bentwood Rockers**  
Pioneered by Thonet in 1860, these feature steam-bent beech frames and cane seats. Authentic 19th-century models sell for $100–$250, while reproductions are common[5][6].  

### 5. **Rustic Rockers**  
Made from untreated branches in the Adirondack style, these sturdy chairs, often dating to the late 1800s, command up to $920[1][4].  

### 6. **Platform Rockers**  
Introduced in the 1830s, these stationary-base chairs with internal springs address “floor creep” and are valued for Victorian-era examples[12][14].  

### 7. **Wicker Rockers**  
Popularized in the Victorian era, intricately woven models with heart or star motifs sell for $50–$350[5][12].

## Factors Determining Value  

### **Materials and Craftsmanship**  
Hardwoods like mahogany, walnut, and maple indicate pre-20th-century construction, while particleboard or composites suggest modern replicas[1][7]. Hand-cut dovetail joints and square nails (pre-1860) authenticate age, whereas machine-made dovetails and Phillips screws signal later production[5][15].  

### **Provenance and Maker Marks**  
Labels from renowned makers like Stickley or Thonet significantly increase value. For instance, a labeled L. & J.G. Stickley rocker sells for $3,000–$5,000[1][10]. Shaker chairs with leg-mounted metal tags are particularly prized[1][5].  

### **Condition and Originality**  
Unrestored pieces with original shellac finishes (pre-1860) or milk paint retain higher value. Repairs, especially using modern adhesives, can reduce worth by 30–50%[5][9].  

### **Design and Rarity**  
Ornate Victorian rockers with upholstery or stenciling are less common than Windsor styles, fetching premiums at auction[12][14]. Sam Maloof’s mid-century designs, such as a 1986 walnut-and-ebony rocker sold for $80,500, highlight the impact of artistic innovation[3][13].

## Identification and Authentication  

### **Visual Inspection**  
- **Joinery:** Hand-cut mortise-and-tenon joints with wooden pegs indicate pre-1850 construction, while machine-cut dovetails suggest post-Industrial Revolution[5][15].  
- **Hardware:** Square nails or rosehead nails (pre-1840) confirm antiquity; wire nails (post-1880) imply later manufacture[1][7].  
- **Patina:** Natural darkening and shrinkage of wood over centuries, contrasted with artificially distressed finishes[1][7].  

### **Finish Analysis**  
Shellac, used until 1860, dissolves with denatured alcohol, whereas lacquer (post-1860) remains intact. Flaking varnish or wax residues also signal age[5][9].  

### **Documentation**  
Cross-referencing with historical catalogs, such as Lambert Hitchcock’s 1820s design portfolios, can verify authenticity[1][14].

---

## Preservation and Care  

### **Environmental Controls**

- Maintain 40–60% humidity to minimize warping[9].  

### **Cleaning Techniques**  
- Dust with microfiber cloths; use mild soap for stains[7][15].
