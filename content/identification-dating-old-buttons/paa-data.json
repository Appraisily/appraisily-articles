How can I tell how old my buttons are?**\n\n**Answer:** Dating old buttons requires a multi-faceted approach, combining visual analysis with historical context. Start by examining the button's material: early buttons were often made of natural materials like bone, wood, shell (mother-of-pearl), or horn. Celluloid buttons became popular in the late 19th century. Plastics like Bakelite appeared in the early 20th century, and later, polyester and nylon became prevalent.\n\nNext, look at the button's construction. Hand-sewn buttons, especially those with visible stitching or shanks made from thread, are generally older. Metal shanks became more common with mass production. Button design also provides clues. Early buttons often featured simple designs or were covered in fabric. Elaborate designs, intricate carvings, or the use of specific motifs can be linked to particular historical periods or fashion trends.\n\nConsider the button's size and shape. Larger buttons were common on earlier garments, while smaller, more refined buttons became popular later. Finally, research button manufacturers' marks or backmarks, if present. Many companies stamped their buttons with their logo or name, which can be used to pinpoint the production date using historical company records or button collector guides. Examining multiple characteristics together provides the most accurate estimate of age.\n\n**2. What are the most common materials used in antique buttons, and how can I identify them?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying the materials used in antique buttons is crucial for dating and understanding their history. Here are some common materials and how to recognize them:\n\n*   **Bone:** Often creamy white or slightly yellowed, bone buttons can have a visible grain or porous texture. They were commonly used in the 18th and 19th centuries. Test: Bone will feel cool to the touch.\n*   **Shell (Mother-of-Pearl):** Iridescent and often with a swirling pattern, shell buttons are beautiful and were popular from the 18th century onwards. Test: They feel smooth and cool, and may show layers.\n*   **Wood:** Wood buttons can vary greatly in color and texture depending on the type of wood used. They were often stained or varnished. Test: Look for wood grain and a lighter weight compared to bone or metal.\n*   **Metal:** Brass, copper, steel, and silver were all used. Look for signs of oxidation or corrosion. Brass buttons often have a golden hue, while copper is reddish-brown.\n*   **Glass:** Often molded or pressed, glass buttons can be clear, colored, or decorated. Test: Glass will feel cool and smooth.\n*   **Celluloid:** An early plastic, celluloid buttons are lightweight and can mimic other materials. They are flammable and can give off a camphor-like smell if heated. Test: This test should only be done by professionals due to the flammability.\n*   **Bakelite:** An early thermosetting plastic. Bakelite buttons are often dark in color (black, brown, or dark red) and have a smooth, polished surface. Test: The Simichrome test can help identify Bakelite.\n\n**3. How do I determine the value of my old buttons?**\n\n**Answer:** Assessing the value of old buttons involves several factors, making it a somewhat subjective process. Start by identifying the button's material, age, and rarity. Rare materials, like certain types of enamel or unusual metals, increase value. Buttons from specific historical periods or associated with notable events are also more valuable.\n\nThe condition of the button is paramount. Buttons in excellent condition, without chips, cracks, or significant wear, are worth more. Complex designs, intricate details, and high-quality craftsmanship also contribute to value. Buttons with unique designs or those made by well-known manufacturers are highly sought after.\n\nResearching similar buttons online through auction sites like eBay (checking completed listings for actual selling prices) and specialized button collecting websites can provide a baseline. Consulting with a knowledgeable button collector or appraiser is advisable for more accurate valuations, especially for rare or unusual buttons. Remember that demand from collectors also plays a significant role in determining value, so trends can fluctuate. Don't forget to factor in the button's story or provenance, if known, as this can add to its allure and value.\n\n**4. What are some common markings or backmarks found on old buttons, and what do they indicate?**\n\n**Answer:** Backmarks or markings on old buttons are invaluable clues to their origin and age. These markings often include the manufacturer's name, logo, location, or patent information. Recognizing these markings is a key skill for button collectors.\n\n*   **Company Names:** \"Waterbury Button Co.,\" \"Scovill Mfg. Co.,\" and \"Horstmann\" are examples of prominent American button manufacturers whose names frequently appear on backmarks. Researching these companies can provide specific dating information.\n*   **City and State:** The inclusion of a city and state (e.g., \"Paris, France,\" \"Birmingham, England\") indicates where the button was manufactured.\n*   **Patent Dates:** Buttons marked with \"Pat. Appld. For\" or specific patent dates can be dated to the period after the patent application or grant.\n*   **Military Buttons:** Military buttons often feature specific branch insignia or unit designations, alongside the manufacturer's mark. These can be cross-referenced with military history records.\n*   **Advertising Buttons:** Many advertising buttons feature the name or logo of a product or company. These can be dated based on the product's marketing history.\n\nReference guides and online resources dedicated to button backmarks are essential tools for identification. Documenting and researching these markings is crucial for accurately dating and understanding the history of your buttons.\n\n**5. What are some common mistakes people make when trying to identify and date old buttons?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying and dating old buttons can be tricky, and several common mistakes can lead to inaccurate conclusions. One frequent error is relying solely on visual appearance without considering other factors. For instance, a button that looks like bone might actually be an early plastic imitation.\n\nAnother mistake is neglecting to research button manufacturers' marks. Many collectors overlook these crucial clues, missing out on valuable dating information. Failing to consider the context of the button's use is also a common oversight. A button from a military uniform, for example, might be mistakenly identified as a civilian button if its military significance is ignored.\n\nOverestimating the age of a button is another frequent error. Just because a button *looks* old doesn't necessarily mean it is. Mass-produced buttons can sometimes mimic the appearance of earlier, handcrafted ones. Similarly, assuming that all metal buttons are old is incorrect. Many modern buttons are made of metal alloys.\n\nFinally, neglecting to consult with experienced button collectors or reference guides can lead to misidentification. Seeking expert advice and using reliable resources are essential for avoiding these common pitfalls.\n\n**6. Where can I find and buy or sell old buttons for collecting?**\n\n**Answer:** The world of button collecting offers numerous avenues for buying, selling, and discovering these fascinating historical artifacts. Here are several popular options:\n\n*   **Antique Shops and Flea Markets:** These are excellent places to stumble upon hidden treasures. Regularly visiting local antique shops and flea markets can yield unexpected finds. Be prepared to haggle and examine buttons carefully.\n*   **Online Auction Sites:** eBay is a vast marketplace for buying and selling buttons. Use specific search terms (e.g., \"vintage glass buttons,\" \"military uniform buttons\") and carefully review seller feedback before making a purchase. Check completed listings to get an idea of market value.\n*   **Specialized Button Collecting Websites:** Several websites cater specifically to button collectors, offering a curated selection of buttons and related resources. These sites often have forums or communities where you can connect with other collectors.\n*   **Button Shows and Conventions:** Attending button shows and conventions is a great way to meet other collectors, learn about buttons, and buy or sell items. These events often feature expert appraisals and educational seminars.\n*   **Estate Sales and Auctions:** Estate sales and auctions can be a goldmine for finding large collections of buttons. Be prepared to bid competitively and inspect buttons thoroughly before making a purchase.\n\n**7. Are there any resources or books that are helpful for identifying old buttons?**\n\n**Answer:** Absolutely!
