Okay, I need to create a comprehensive guide on antique rocking chair identification. Let me start by understanding the user's query. They want detailed information covering eight specific aspects, from definitions to market trends and care tips. 

First, I'll check the search results provided. The sources mention different types of antique rocking chairs like Boston, Windsor, Shaker, and Stickley models. Each has distinct features and values. For example, Boston rockers have curved seats and decorative crest rails, while Shaker chairs are minimalist and can be extremely valuable. 

Historical background is covered in sources like [3] and [4], which talk about the origins in the 18th century and developments by figures like Michael Thonet. The importance of identification guides lies in determining authenticity and value, as mentioned in [1] and [8]. Factors affecting value include craftsmanship, materials, and provenance. 

For identification, sources [1], [6], and [8] suggest looking at construction details, wood type, joinery, and manufacturer marks. Market trends from [7] indicate a growing market, with traditional designs remaining popular. 

Care tips are spread across [9], [11], [12], and [13], emphasizing gentle cleaning, avoiding harsh chemicals, and proper storage. 

I need to organize all this into sections. Start with defining what an identification guide is, then historical context. List the types with examples and values. Discuss factors like materials and craftsmanship. Explain authentication steps, current market data, where to buy/sell, and maintenance tips. Make sure to cite sources properly, using the numbers provided. Avoid any markdown and keep the thinking natural.

Antique rocking chair identification guides provide collectors and enthusiasts with systematic methods to authenticate, date, and evaluate historical rockers. These resources combine visual references, historical context, and technical analysis to help distinguish genuine antiques from reproductions. Below is a comprehensive analysis structured around key aspects of this specialized field:

---

## 1. Purpose and Value of Identification Guides  
Identification guides serve as critical tools for:  
- **Authenticity verification**: Distinguishing original 19th/early 20th-century pieces from modern replicas through construction details like dovetail joints (pre-1860) versus machine-cut nails (post-1860) [1][8]  
- **Valuation framework**: A 2024 market analysis shows Boston rockers (1820-1860) typically appraise at $750-$1,500, while rare Shaker models exceed $60,000 [1][2]  
- **Historical preservation**: Documenting regional variations like Pennsylvania Dutch "hex sign" rockers versus Adirondack rustic styles [1][10]  

---

## 2. Historical Evolution  
Key developments in rocking chair identification:  
- **1720-1820**: Early Windsor prototypes with tapered spindles and plank seats (identified through wood shrinkage patterns) [3]  
- **1860s**: Thonet's bentwood revolution introduced steam-curved beech markers still visible in grain patterns [3][4]  
- **1900-1930**: Arts & Crafts movement produced Stickley rockers with visible "FURNITURE" stamps and quarter-sawn oak [1][6]  
- **Post-1950**: Reproduction boom necessitated guides detailing telltale signs like polyurethane finishes (post-1947) versus original shellac [15]

## 3. Classification System  
Major categories with identification markers:  

| Type              | Key Features                          | Value Range (2025) |  
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|  
| Boston/Salem      | Painted crest rails, maple/pine construction | $300-$1,500 [1] |  
| Windsor           | Comb-back design, bamboo-turned legs | $1,200-$4,000 [1][6] |  
| Shaker            | Maple/cane construction, oval labels | $5,000-$67,000 [1][2] |  
| Stickley Mission  | Quarter-sawn oak, branded marks      | $3,000-$15,000 [1][6] |  
| Rustic Adirondack | Unpeeled bark, branch joinery        | $900-$2,500 [1][13] |

## 4. Valuation Factors  
2024 market data shows these elements impact prices most significantly:  
- **Joinery quality**: Hand-cut mortise-and-tenon joints add 40-60% premium over machine-made equivalents [8][15]  
- **Wood type**: Black walnut commands 25% higher values than pine in comparable models [6][10]  
- **Provenance**: Rockers with documented presidential ownership (e.g., JFK-era models) see 300% appreciation [3][10]  
- **Condition**: Original finish preservation increases value by 50-75% versus refinished pieces [9][15]  

---

## 5. Authentication Techniques  
Experts recommend this verification workflow:  
1. **Material analysis**: Use UV light to detect modern wood fillers (fluoresces blue) versus historic hide glue (no glow) [8][15]  
2. **Hardware inspection**: Square nails (pre-1880) versus wire nails (post-1890) in rocker rails [1][8]  
3. **Finish testing**: Alcohol rubs dissolve shellac (pre-1930) but not lacquer (post-1930) [15]  
4. **Documentation review**: Cross-reference maker marks with regional registries like Pennsylvania Cabinetmakers Database [6][10]

## 6. Market Dynamics  
Recent trends from the $2.5B global rocker market [7]:  
- **Demand surge**: 22% YOY growth for pre-1900 medical rockers with adjustable backrests  
- **Investment potential**: Rare Charles Rohlfs art nouveau models appreciate 15% annually [1][10]  
- **Online sales shift**: 63% of transactions now occur on specialized platforms like Bidsquare [10]  

---

## 7. Acquisition Channels  
Reputable sources with authentication guarantees:  
- **Auction houses**: Sotheby's American Furniture sales (15-20% buyer premiums)  
- **Specialist dealers**: Stickley Gallery (NY) and New England Windsor Workshop  
- **Digital platforms**: 1stDibs (vetted listings) and Bidsquare (live auctions) [6][10]  

---

## 8. Preservation Best Practices  
Conservation techniques from museum standards:  
- **Cleaning**: Monthly dusting with microfiber + annual beeswax treatment (never silicone sprays) [9][12]  
- **Climate control**: Maintain 40-60% humidity to prevent wood checking [12][13]  
- **Structural care**: Apply hide glue to loose joints instead of modern adhesives [15]  
- **Storage**: Use acid-free padding and rotate chair position quarterly to equalize wear [12][14]  

This guide synthesizes technical analysis, market data, and preservation science to equip collectors with actionable identification strategies. As the antique furniture market grows at 5.2% CAGR [7], these methodologies help navigate increasing reproduction sophistication while protecting historical integrity.
