How can I identify a genuinely old brown Lysol bottle?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying a genuinely old brown Lysol bottle involves looking at several key characteristics. Firstly, the color is crucial. Authentic older bottles are a deep, rich brown, not the lighter amber or yellow shades sometimes seen in reproductions or later bottles. Examine the bottle's seams. Older bottles were often made with a two- or three-piece mold, leaving noticeable seams along the sides and sometimes on the base. These seams might be less defined or absent in newer bottles. Check for embossed lettering. Older bottles often have raised lettering indicating the brand name (\"Lysol\"), the manufacturer (\"Lehn & Fink\"), and sometimes warnings or instructions. The clarity and sharpness of this embossing can indicate age. Examine the bottle's base. Older bottles might have a \"pontil mark,\" a rough scar left from when the bottle was broken from the glassblower's rod. However, not all old bottles have pontil marks. Look closely at the glass itself. Older glass may contain imperfections like bubbles or swirls, which are less common in modern manufacturing. Finally, check for any paper labels. Original labels, even if damaged, can provide valuable information about the bottle's age and contents. Comparing your bottle to known examples found in antique bottle guides or online resources can also be helpful.\n\n**2. What factors influence the value of an old brown Lysol bottle?**\n\n**Answer:** Several factors play a significant role in determining the value of an old brown Lysol bottle. The condition of the bottle is paramount. Bottles free from cracks, chips, or significant scratches are worth considerably more. The presence and condition of the original label significantly impact value. A complete, legible, and well-preserved label can double or even triple the price. Rarity also plays a crucial role. Certain variations, such as those with specific embossing, unique shapes, or bottles produced for a limited time, are more valuable. For example, bottles with particular tax stamps or those from early production years (pre-1920s) tend to be highly sought after. The bottle's size can also affect its value, with larger or unusual sizes often commanding higher prices. Demand from collectors also influences price. If there's a strong demand for a particular type of Lysol bottle, its value will increase. Finally, provenance (the bottle's documented history) can add value if it can be traced back to a specific event or person.\n\n**3. What is the typical price range for old brown Lysol bottles?**\n\n**Answer:** The price range for old brown Lysol bottles is quite broad, varying from a few dollars to several hundred, depending on the factors mentioned above. Common, heavily damaged bottles with no label might only be worth $5-$15. More common bottles in good condition with partial labels might fetch $20-$50. Bottles in excellent condition with complete and legible labels, especially those with unique features or from early production periods, can sell for $75-$200 or more. Very rare variations, such as those with unusual embossing, specific tax stamps, or bottles associated with historical events (e.g., flu pandemic era), can command prices upwards of $300, and in exceptional cases, even exceeding $500. Always check recently sold listings on platforms like eBay or specialized antique bottle auction sites to get a sense of the current market value for bottles similar to yours. Remember that asking prices are not necessarily selling prices.\n\n**4. What were old brown Lysol bottles used for, and what is their historical significance?**\n\n**Answer:** Old brown Lysol bottles primarily contained a disinfectant solution used for a wide range of purposes, from household cleaning and sanitation to medical disinfection. Lysol was heavily marketed as a germicide and was widely used in hospitals, homes, and even birthing centers. Its historical significance stems from its role in public health during the early 20th century. During the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918-1919, Lysol was heavily promoted as a way to combat the spread of the virus, leading to widespread use and recognition. The brown bottle itself was a deliberate design choice, intended to protect the light-sensitive ingredients of the disinfectant. Unfortunately, Lysol was also marketed for purposes that are now considered harmful and unethical, including use as a feminine hygiene product, which caused serious health consequences for some women. Understanding this complex history is important when collecting or discussing these bottles.\n\n**5. Where can I buy or sell old brown Lysol bottles?**\n\n**Answer:** Several avenues exist for buying and selling old brown Lysol bottles. Online marketplaces like eBay and Etsy are popular options, offering a wide selection of bottles at varying price points. However, exercise caution and carefully examine photos and descriptions before purchasing. Specialized antique bottle auction sites, such as those run by Glass Works Auctions or American Bottle Auctions, are excellent resources for finding rare and high-value bottles. Local antique stores and flea markets can also be good places to find Lysol bottles, although the selection may be more limited. When selling, consider the platform that best suits your bottle's value and condition. For lower-value bottles, eBay or Etsy might be suitable. For higher-value or rare bottles, consignment with a reputable antique bottle auction house is often the best option to reach serious collectors. Always research the market value of your bottle before listing it for sale to ensure you are asking a fair price.\n\n**6. What are some common problems or challenges when collecting old brown Lysol bottles?**\n\n**Answer:** Collecting old brown Lysol bottles comes with its own set of challenges. One common problem is identifying reproductions or fakes. These can be difficult to spot, especially for novice collectors. Thorough research and careful examination of the bottle's features are crucial. Another challenge is the condition of the bottles. Many old Lysol bottles are found with chips, cracks, or damaged labels, which significantly reduce their value. Storing and preserving the bottles can also be challenging. Exposure to sunlight can fade the glass and labels, so it's important to store them in a cool, dark place. Dust and dirt can also accumulate over time, so gentle cleaning with a soft cloth and mild soap is recommended. Finally, finding rare variations can be difficult and time-consuming. Building a comprehensive collection requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to invest time in research and networking with other collectors.\n\n**7. Are there any books or online resources that can help me learn more about old brown Lysol bottles and their value?**\n\n**Answer:** Yes, several valuable resources can help you learn more about old brown Lysol bottles and their value. While a book dedicated solely to Lysol bottles might be scarce, general antique bottle collecting guides often include information on Lysol bottles and other common household bottles. \"Red Book #11: A Price Guide of Antique Bottles\" by Douglas Leybourne Jr. is a commonly used reference guide. Online, look for websites dedicated to antique bottle collecting, such as the Federation of Historical Bottle Collectors (FOHBC) website. Many online forums and communities dedicated to antique bottle collecting offer valuable information, advice, and opportunities to connect with other collectors. eBay completed listings can also provide a sense of current market prices. Google Scholar can be used to find academic articles about the history of Lysol and its marketing, providing valuable context. Be wary of information from unverified sources and always cross-reference information from multiple sources.\n",
