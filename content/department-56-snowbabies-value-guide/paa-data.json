What are Department 56 Snowbabies and why are some worth more than others?**\n\n**Answer:** Department 56 Snowbabies are collectible porcelain bisque figurines depicting children (and sometimes animals) in snow-covered scenes. They were first introduced in 1986 and quickly gained popularity. Their value hinges on several factors: rarity, condition, age, and demand. Limited edition pieces, especially those from early years, tend to be more valuable due to their scarcity. Condition is paramount; mint condition Snowbabies with original packaging command higher prices. Figurines with unique characteristics, like particularly detailed features or unusual poses, can also be more sought after.\n\n*   **Rarity:** Limited edition runs, retired pieces, and promotional figurines are generally rarer.\n*   **Condition:** Look for chips, cracks, crazing (fine lines in the glaze), or repairs. Original packaging and certificates of authenticity add value.\n*   **Age:** Earlier pieces, particularly those from the 1980s and early 1990s, often have higher collectible value.\n*   **Demand:** Popular designs and those associated with specific holidays or events can experience higher demand and therefore, higher prices.\n*   **Provenance:** Pieces with a documented history or ownership by a known collector might also fetch a premium.\n\nUnderstanding these factors is crucial for accurately assessing the value of your Snowbabies collection.\n\n**2. How can I identify a genuine Department 56 Snowbabies figurine?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying genuine Department 56 Snowbabies involves careful examination of several key features. Counterfeits exist, so attention to detail is essential. The most reliable indicator is the Department 56 backstamp or markings. These markings typically include the Department 56 logo (often a stylized \"D56\") and the name \"Snowbabies.\" Early figurines may have different markings compared to later releases.\n\n*   **Backstamp:** Examine the bottom of the figurine for the official Department 56 backstamp. Be wary of missing or poorly defined stamps.\n*   **Material:** Snowbabies are made of porcelain bisque, which has a matte, unglazed finish. The texture should be smooth and consistent.\n*   **Craftsmanship:** Genuine Snowbabies exhibit high-quality craftsmanship. Look for crisp details, clean lines, and well-painted features. Be suspicious of figurines with sloppy paint jobs or poorly defined details.\n*   **Original Packaging:** If available, the original box can be a valuable indicator.
