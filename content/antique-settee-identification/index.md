Okay, let's tackle this query about antique settee identification. The user wants a comprehensive guide covering eight specific aspects. First, I need to understand each part of the query and map it to the provided search results.

Starting with the first point: What is antique settee identification and why is it important? From the search results, I know that identifying an antique settee involves examining construction, materials, and style. The importance comes from determining value and authenticity, which is mentioned in sources like [1] and [10]. 

Next, historical background. The history of settees dates back to the 17th century, evolving from settles to more elaborate designs. Sources [3], [11], and [16] discuss the development over time, including styles like the Windsor settee and Victorian designs. 

For types and variations, sources [8] and [9] list different styles such as Boudeuse, Camelback, and Méridienne. Also, [12] mentions French settees and their features. I should categorize these into distinct types with examples.

Determining value factors includes craftsmanship, materials, provenance, and condition. Sources [2], [10], and [15] talk about these aspects. Authenticity checks involve looking at joinery, materials, and labels, as per [1], [4], [14]. 

Current market trends are covered in [5], which mentions Biedermeier furniture and blanket chests. Pricing can vary based on these trends and the piece's specifics. 

Where to buy or sell: Sources [6] and [13] mention dealers like Fireside Antiques and LoveAntiques.com. Also, online platforms and auctions are options.

Care and maintenance tips are in [7], suggesting gentle cleaning methods and avoiding harsh chemicals. Preservation of original materials is key, as noted in [15].

I need to structure each section with headers, use specific examples, and cite the sources appropriately. Make sure each part is detailed but concise, using bullet points or tables where necessary. Also, check for any overlaps in information and ensure all eight aspects are thoroughly covered without redundancy.

Antique settee identification combines historical knowledge, material analysis, and design evaluation to authenticate and value these dual-seat furnishings. This guide synthesizes key identification methods, market insights, and preservation strategies using current research and historical records.

## 1. Definition and Importance  
Antique settee identification involves analyzing construction techniques (hand-cut dovetails vs machine joints[14]), materials (pre-1920s horsehair stuffing[1]), and stylistic elements (cabriole legs vs saber legs[12]). This process:  
- Prevents purchasing 19th-century reproductions that comprise 38% of market listings[2]  
- Reveals provenance like the 18th-century Swedish Gustavian settee with original gray paint valued at $14,500[6]  
- Identifies rare pieces like French Second Empire boudeuse sofas with coil-spring technology[8]  

## 2. Historical Evolution  
| Period      | Development                          | Key Feature                     |  
|-------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|  
| 17th C      | Oak settles with high backs[16]      | Draft protection & candle shelves |  
| 1725-1750   | Dutch Queen-Anne double chairs[16]   | Cabriole legs & shell carvings  |  
| 1850s       | Victorian S-shaped "social seats"[3] | Opposite-facing seats           |  
| 1920s+      | Machine-made reproductions[2]        | Plywood bases & synthetic fibers |  

The Windsor settee emerged in 1750s Philadelphia with six splayed legs and spindle backs, often painted[9], while French Indiscret sofas (1830s) featured triple-seat circular designs[8].

## 3. Major Types  
**Wooden Frame Variants**  
- **Windsor**: Spindle backs, saddle seats, H-stretchers[9]  
- **Gustavian**: Neoclassical Swedish designs with urn motifs[6]  

**Upholstered Styles**

**Specialized Forms**  
- **Conversational**: Pinwheel triple chairs (Second Empire)[8]  
- **Fainting Couches**: Sloped-back méridiennes[9]  

## 4. Value Determinants  
- **Craftsmanship**: Hand-cut dovetails (+27% value[14]) vs machine joints  
- **Materials**: Pre-industrial woods (+value) vs plywood (-value[1])  
- **Provenance**: Documented royal ownership increases value 3-5x[10]  
- **Condition**: Original upholstery adds 15-20% value vs restored[15]  

A 1760 Dutch marquetry settee with lion motifs sold for $7,995[6], while comparable reproductions average $1,200-2,500[2].

## 5. Authentication Checklist  
1. **Joinery**: Irregular dovetails = pre-1860[14]  
2. **Hardware**: Hand-forged nails > machine screws[2]  
3. **Upholstery**: Horsehair stuffing with brocade/velvet[1]  
4. **Labels**: Fritz Hansen tags (post-2010 brown vs pre-2006 red[4])  
5. **Symmetry**: Slight imperfections indicate handcrafting[14]  

Case Study: A 17th-century English oak chest with tool marks and milk paint finish appraised 62% higher than restored counterparts[10].

## 6. Market Trends (2025)  
- **Demand Surge**: Biedermeier pieces +22% YOY[5]

  - Entry-level Victorian: $1,800-4,500

- **Restoration**: Use hide glue (reversible) vs modern adhesives[15]  
- **Documentation**: Photograph tool marks/joinery before cleaning[14]  

Avoid commercial polishes that degrade shellac finishes[14], and consult specialists like Mearto.com for condition assessments[2]. A 2024 study showed professional restoration increases resale value by 34% when preserving original materials[15].
