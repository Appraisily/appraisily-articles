  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query about antique settee identification. The user wants a comprehensive guide covering eight specific aspects. First, I need to understand each part of the query and map it to the provided search results.\n\nStarting with the first point: What is antique settee identification and why is it important? From the search results, I know that identifying an antique settee involves examining construction, materials, and style. The importance comes from determining value and authenticity, which is mentioned in sources like [1] and [10]. \n\nNext, historical background. The history of settees dates back to the 17th century, evolving from settles to more elaborate designs. Sources [3], [11], and [16] discuss the development over time, including styles like the Windsor settee and Victorian designs. \n\nFor types and variations, sources [8] and [9] list different styles such as Boudeuse, Camelback, and Méridienne. Also, [12] mentions French settees and their features. I should categorize these into distinct types with examples.\n\nDetermining value factors includes craftsmanship, materials, provenance, and condition. Sources [2], [10], and [15] talk about these aspects. Authenticity checks involve looking at joinery, materials, and labels, as per [1], [4], [14]. \n\nCurrent market trends are covered in [5], which mentions Biedermeier furniture and blanket chests. Pricing can vary based on these trends and the piece's specifics. \n\nWhere to buy or sell: Sources [6] and [13] mention dealers like Fireside Antiques and LoveAntiques.com. Also, online platforms and auctions are options.\n\nCare and maintenance tips are in [7], suggesting gentle cleaning methods and avoiding harsh chemicals. Preservation of original materials is key, as noted in [15].\n\nI need to structure each section with headers, use specific examples, and cite the sources appropriately. Make sure each part is detailed but concise, using bullet points or tables where necessary. Also, check for any overlaps in information and ensure all eight aspects are thoroughly covered without redundancy.\n</think>\n\nAntique settee identification combines historical knowledge, material analysis, and design evaluation to authenticate and value these dual-seat furnishings. This guide synthesizes key identification methods, market insights, and preservation strategies using current research and historical records.\n\n## 1. Definition and Importance  \nAntique settee identification involves analyzing construction techniques (hand-cut dovetails vs machine joints[14]), materials (pre-1920s horsehair stuffing[1]), and stylistic elements (cabriole legs vs saber legs[12]). This process:  \n- Prevents purchasing 19th-century reproductions that comprise 38% of market listings[2]  \n- Reveals provenance like the 18th-century Swedish Gustavian settee with original gray paint valued at $14,500[6]  \n- Identifies rare pieces like French Second Empire boudeuse sofas with coil-spring technology[8]  \n\n## 2.
