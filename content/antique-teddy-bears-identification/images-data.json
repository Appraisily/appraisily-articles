    "prompt": "Photorealistic macro shot focusing on the identification features of an early 20th-century antique teddy bear. Positioned slightly left of center is a single, worn amber glass eye reflecting soft, directional window light. Adjacent, the coarse texture of faded golden mohair fur is rendered in extreme detail, showing individual strands and patches of wear. A subtle hint of the wood wool (excelsior) stuffing peeks through a carefully stitched repair near the shoulder joint area. Shallow depth of field keeps the eye and fur texture sharp while softly blurring the immediate background. Lighting is soft and natural, emphasizing the textures and aged materials. Professional, informative style suitable for an identification guide. --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6.0",

A well-worn, circa 1920s teddy bear with characteristically long limbs lies centrally on a dark, aged wood surface. Arranged neatly around it are essential identification tools: a vintage brass magnifying glass positioned over the bear's paw pad (as if searching for marks), a cloth measuring tape stretched alongside a limb, tweezers carefully holding a small sample of wood wool stuffing, and an open reference book displaying illustrations of early bear types and joint mechanisms. Bright, even overhead studio lighting ensures clarity and detail across the entire scene. Professional, informative, and meticulously detailed aesthetic. --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6.0",

The texture of the aged fur, the structure of the ear, and the fabric weave of the glove are highly detailed.
