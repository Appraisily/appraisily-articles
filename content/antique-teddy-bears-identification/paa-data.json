How can I tell if my teddy bear is truly antique?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the authenticity of an antique teddy bear requires a careful examination of several key features.  Simply being old doesn't make a bear antique; it needs to possess characteristics indicative of its era.  Look for these clues:\n\n* **Construction:**  Early bears (pre-1920s) often used  jointing methods like button joints, which are visible as small buttons or discs on the limbs.  Later bears might use disc joints or more sophisticated internal mechanisms.  Examine the stitching; hand-stitching is a strong indicator of age, especially if uneven or showing variations in thread color.\n* **Materials:**  The type of materials used can be highly indicative.  Early bears often used mohair (angora goat hair) for their fur, which has a unique texture and luster.  Examine the stuffing; sawdust, wood shavings, or even straw were common in older bears, whereas later ones used cotton or synthetic materials.  Check for the presence of glass eyes versus plastic or painted eyes.\n* **Mohair Quality:** Mohair from earlier periods tended to be of a higher quality and often exhibits a luxurious sheen.  Examine closely for signs of wear that are consistent with age, not damage.\n* **Maker's Marks:**  Look for any maker's marks, labels, or stamps on the bear's body or clothing.  These can be invaluable in identifying the manufacturer and dating the bear.  Research known manufacturers and their markings.  Be wary of added labels.\n* **Condition:** While wear and tear are expected on antiques, significant damage or heavy repairs can diminish value and authenticity.  A professional appraisal can help determine the extent of any restoration.\n\n**2. What are the most valuable antique teddy bear brands or makers?**\n\n**Answer:** Several manufacturers produced highly sought-after and valuable antique teddy bears.
