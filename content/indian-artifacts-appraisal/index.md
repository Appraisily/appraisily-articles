Okay, I need to tackle this comprehensive query about Indian artifacts appraisal. Let me start by breaking down each of the eight points the user wants covered. 

First, understanding what Indian artifacts appraisal is and why it's important. From the search results, I see that appraisal involves determining the fair market value of Native American artifacts. The importance comes from establishing authenticity, provenance, and value for insurance, sales, or legal purposes. Sources like [1] and [3] mention professional services that offer appraisals, so I should cite those.

Next, historical background. The search results don't have a lot on the history of appraisals specifically, but [5] talks about the evolution of the Indian art market over the last five years. Maybe I can tie that into how appraisal practices have developed alongside market growth. Also, [8] and [15] mention legal aspects like NAGPRA, which might relate to the historical context of repatriation and its impact on appraisals.

Different types of appraisals are covered in [1], which lists on-site, internet, and mail appraisals. [3] and [17] mention different appraisal services like insurance values or IRS valuations. I should categorize these types clearly, maybe using bullet points or a table if needed.

Factors determining value are discussed in [2], [3], and [8]. Key points include condition, provenance, rarity, age, materials, and cultural significance. [3] gives examples of high-value items sold, like the Clovis point and Pueblo pottery. I need to list these factors and provide examples from the sources.

Identifying authentic appraisals would involve checking the appraiser's credentials, avoiding conflicts of interest, and looking for certifications. Sources [3], [7], and [18] mention organizations like IAGA and accredited appraisers. Also, [6] talks about authentication services, which tie into appraisal credibility.

Current market trends from [5] show growth in the Indian art market, with a CAGR of 14.9%. Online platforms and NFTs are mentioned as emerging trends. Auction records from [3] and [5] (like Tyeb Mehta's work) can serve as data points.

Where to buy/sell: Auction houses, online platforms (ArtZolo, Mojarto), and specialized dealers like [17] and [18]. Also, [7] mentions liquidation services. I should list these venues and maybe note the shift to online sales mentioned in [5].

Care and preservation tips come from [9], [10], [12], and [14]. Proper storage, avoiding light, controlled humidity, and professional conservation are key. The PDFs from [10] and [12] have specific methods, like using Tyvek pillows for textiles. Also, handling guidelines from [14] and [16] (like using padded surfaces) are important.

I need to structure each section with headers, use citations appropriately, and include examples. Make sure to avoid any markdown in the thinking but follow the format rules for the final answer. Check that all eight points are addressed thoroughly, using the most relevant sources for each part. Also, ensure that the answer is comprehensive but not too verbose, balancing detail with clarity.

## Comprehensive Guide to Indian Artifacts Appraisal  

### 1. **Definition and Importance of Indian Artifacts Appraisal**  
Indian artifacts appraisal involves evaluating the authenticity, provenance, and fair market value of Native American cultural items such as arrowheads, pottery, textiles, jewelry, and ceremonial objects. This process is critical for:  
- **Legal compliance**: Ensuring adherence to laws like the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) [13][15].  
- **Insurance and estate planning**: Establishing replacement values for collections [1][6].  
- **Historical preservation**: Documenting cultural heritage and provenance for future generations [8][9].  
- **Market transactions**: Facilitating sales, auctions, or donations with verified authenticity [3][17].  

Professional appraisers combine expertise in anthropology, art history, and market trends to assess artifacts, often using advanced techniques like thermoluminescence dating or microscopic analysis [2][6][8].

### 2. **Historical Background and Development**  
The appraisal of Native American artifacts evolved alongside the antiquities market and legal frameworks:  
- **Early 20th century**: Collectors and museums began systematizing artifact acquisition, often without tribal consultation [9].  
- **1990s**: NAGPRA mandated repatriation of culturally significant items, increasing demand for authenticated appraisals [13][15].  
- **2000s–present**: Digital platforms (e.g., online auctions, NFT marketplaces) and scientific authentication methods (e.g., IAGA’s microscopic analysis) revolutionized appraisal practices [5][6][7].  

---

### 3. **Types of Appraisal Services**  
- **On-site appraisals**: Experts evaluate collections in person, ideal for large or fragile items [1][17].  
- **Online appraisals**: Submit photos for evaluation ($10–$25 per item), offered by IAGA and Mearto [1][4].  
- **Mail-in services**: Ship artifacts for grading and authentication ($25–$50 per item + return shipping) [1][6].  
- **Specialized certifications**:  
  - **Insurance appraisals**: For coverage claims (e.g., Native American Art Appraisals, Inc.) [3].  
  - **IRS-compliant valuations**: For tax-deductible donations [17].

### 4. **Factors Determining Value**  
Key criteria include:  
| Factor | Impact on Value | Example |  
|--------|-----------------|---------|  
| **Authenticity** | Certified artifacts command higher prices | IAGA-graded items include microscopic analysis reports [6][7]. |  
| **Provenance** | Documented history increases value | A 4,800-year-old butterfly banner with provenance sold for $1,200 [3]. |  
| **Condition** | Minimal damage preserves value | Navajo Chief’s blankets in pristine condition fetch six-figure sums [4][12]. |  
| **Rarity** | Unique items drive demand | Clovis stone points (11,000–13,000 years old) sell for $1,750+ [3]. |  
| **Cultural significance** | Ceremonial objects or tribal-specific art hold premium value | Pueblo pottery and Northwest Coast totem poles are highly sought [4][9].

### 5. **Identifying Authentic Appraisals**  
- **Credentials**: Seek appraisers accredited by organizations like the International Society of Appraisers (e.g., Richard Associates Art Appraisals) [18].  
- **Conflict-free services**: Avoid appraisers offering to buy evaluated items [3].  
- **Certification details**: Legitimate reports include:  
  - Material analysis (e.g., fiber content in textiles) [2][12].  
  - Comparative market data (e.g., auction records for similar artifacts) [5][17].  
  - IAGA or Mearto certificates with embossed seals and unique IDs [4][6].

  - Tyeb Mehta’s *Untitled (Bull on Rickshaw)* sold for $3.35M (2021) [5].  
  - Historic Navajo blankets: $50,000–$500,000 at auction [4][18].

- **Specialized dealers**:  
  - Native American Trading Company (Jack Lima) for historic artifacts [17].  
  - IAGA liquidation services for certified collections [7].

### 8. **Preservation and Care Guidelines**  
- **Storage**: Use acid-free boxes, Tyvek® covers, and climate-controlled environments (50% humidity, 65–70°F) [10][12].  
- **Handling**: Wear gloves, avoid direct sunlight, and pad surfaces to prevent abrasion [12][14][16].  
- **Conservation**:  
  - **Textiles**: Stabilize frayed edges with reversible adhesives; avoid rewashing [12].  
  - **Pottery**: Repair cracks using epoxy resins approved by conservators [11].
