Avoid markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer should follow the user's format rules.\n</think>\n\nAntique plow identification involves determining the historical, functional, and manufacturing details of vintage agricultural implements. Below is a structured guide to this specialized field, drawing from historical records, collector expertise, and market data.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **What Is Antique Plow Identification?**  \nAntique plow identification is the process of determining a plow’s age, manufacturer, type, and historical context through physical features, markings, and design. It is valuable for:  \n- Preserving agricultural heritage  \n- Assessing collectible or resale value (e.g., John Deere plows often command premium prices[3][10])  \n- Informing restoration efforts (e.g., matching original paint colors[15])  \n\n---\n\n## 2. **Historical Background**  \nPlows evolved from wooden tools in ancient Mesopotamia to iron-bladed implements in China’s Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220)[2]. Key developments include:  \n- **Heavy moldboard plows**: Enabled deeper soil turnover in Europe (AD 1000), boosting agricultural productivity[2].  \n- **Industrial-era innovations**: John Deere’s 1837 steel plow revolutionized durability in sticky soils[3].  \n- **Specialization**: By the 19th century, plows were tailored for crops like potatoes or sod[11].  \n\n---\n\n## 3. **Types and Categories**  \nAntique plows are classified by design and function:  \n\n| Type              | Features                                  | Example Models                     |  \n|-------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  \n| **Moldboard**     | Curved blade for soil inversion          | John Deere \"Little Genius\"[1][9]  |  \n| **Walking**       | Handles for operator guidance            | Carey wooden moldboard (1700s)[11]|  \n| **Sulky**         | Seat for ride-along use                  | Gilpin Moore \"King of Sulkies\"[15]|  \n| **Horse-drawn**   | Designed for animal traction             | Parlin & Orendorff two-bottom[10] |  \n| **Garden**        | Compact for small plots                  | Arcade McCormick-Deering[4][9]    |  \n\n---\n\n## 4. **Value Determinants**  \nKey factors influencing worth:  \n- **Condition**: Restored plows with original parts fetch 20–50% more (e.g., $3,313 average on 1stDibs[7]).  \n- **Rarity**: Pre-1850 wooden plows with iron shares are scarce[9][11].  \n- **Provenance**: Plows tied to historical events or figures (e.g., David Peeler’s 1816 Dutch Colony plow[11]) gain premium value.  \n- **Manufacturer**: John Deere and Oliver models dominate high-end auctions[10][15].  \n\n---\n\n## 5. **Identification Techniques**  \nTo authenticate and classify plows:  \n1. **Material analysis**: Early plows combined wood and wrought iron; post-1850 models used cast iron[9][11].  \n2. **Markings**: Look for stamps like \"J.I. Case\" or patent numbers (e.g., Jethro Wood’s 1819 patent[11]).  \n3. **Blade shape**: Moldboards transitioned from flat (1700s) to twisted designs (late 1800s)[2][9].  \n4. **Community resources**: Forums like Yesterday’s Tractors provide crowdsourced insights[6][12].  \n\n---\n\n## 6. **Market Trends (2025)**  \n- **Demand**: Niche interest persists, with rare sulky plows selling for $5,000–$20,000[7][10].  \n- **Pricing tiers**:  \n  - Common walking plows: $100–$300  \n  - Horse-drawn models: $200–$500  \n  - Restored tractor-pulled plows: $300–$700[10]  \n- **Online platforms**: eBay and 1stDibs dominate sales, though local auctions yield hidden gems[7][12].  \n\n---\n\n## 7. **Acquisition and Sales Channels**  \n- **Auctions**: Specialized farm equipment auctions (e.g., LiveAuctioneers[4])  \n- **Dealers**: Antique stores in rural regions (e.g., Mid-Missouri Antique Power Assn.[11])  \n- **Restoration networks**: Clubs like CRAFTS and Early American Industries Association[16]  \n\n---\n\n## 8. **Preservation Best Practices**  \n- **Cleaning**: Remove soil with soft brushes; avoid abrasive tools to preserve patina[8][13].  \n- **Rust prevention**: Apply linseed oil or John Deere Soft Black Coating to metal surfaces[8].  \n- **Storage**: Keep in dry, climate-controlled spaces to prevent wood warping[9][13].  \n\n---\n\nThis guide synthesizes historical, technical, and market data to equip researchers and collectors with actionable insights. For specialized cases, consult manufacturer archives or agricultural museums[11][16].",
