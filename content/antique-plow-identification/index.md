8. **Care and maintenance**
   - Cleaning, rust prevention with oils/coatings, storage tips. Source [8], [13], [15].

I need to ensure each section cites relevant sources. For example, when discussing types, cite [3] and [9]. For historical background, use [2] and [9]. Manufacturer marks and identification steps from [9], [10], [12]. Pricing data from [4], [7], [10].

Also, include specific examples like the IH Little Genius from [1], John Deere's steel plow [3], and the Jethro Wood patent plow [11]. Mention the valuation tables from [10] to illustrate price factors.

Make sure the answer is structured with headers, uses bullet points or tables where appropriate, and cites sources inline like [1][3][9]. Avoid markdown in the thinking process, but the final answer should follow the user's format rules.

## 1. **What Is Antique Plow Identification?**  
Antique plow identification is the process of determining a plow’s age, manufacturer, type, and historical context through physical features, markings, and design. It is valuable for:  
- Preserving agricultural heritage  
- Assessing collectible or resale value (e.g., John Deere plows often command premium prices[3][10])  
- Informing restoration efforts (e.g., matching original paint colors[15])  

---

## 2. **Historical Background**  
Plows evolved from wooden tools in ancient Mesopotamia to iron-bladed implements in China’s Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220)[2]. Key developments include:  
- **Heavy moldboard plows**: Enabled deeper soil turnover in Europe (AD 1000), boosting agricultural productivity[2].  
- **Industrial-era innovations**: John Deere’s 1837 steel plow revolutionized durability in sticky soils[3].  
- **Specialization**: By the 19th century, plows were tailored for crops like potatoes or sod[11].

## 3. **Types and Categories**  
Antique plows are classified by design and function:  

| Type              | Features                                  | Example Models                     |  
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
| **Moldboard**     | Curved blade for soil inversion          | John Deere "Little Genius"[1][9]  |  
| **Walking**       | Handles for operator guidance            | Carey wooden moldboard (1700s)[11]|  
| **Sulky**         | Seat for ride-along use                  | Gilpin Moore "King of Sulkies"[15]|  
| **Horse-drawn**   | Designed for animal traction             | Parlin & Orendorff two-bottom[10] |  
| **Garden**        | Compact for small plots                  | Arcade McCormick-Deering[4][9]    |

## 4. **Value Determinants**  
Key factors influencing worth:  
- **Condition**: Restored plows with original parts fetch 20–50% more (e.g., $3,313 average on 1stDibs[7]).  
- **Rarity**: Pre-1850 wooden plows with iron shares are scarce[9][11].  
- **Provenance**: Plows tied to historical events or figures (e.g., David Peeler’s 1816 Dutch Colony plow[11]) gain premium value.  
- **Manufacturer**: John Deere and Oliver models dominate high-end auctions[10][15].  

---

## 5. **Identification Techniques**  
To authenticate and classify plows:  
1. **Material analysis**: Early plows combined wood and wrought iron; post-1850 models used cast iron[9][11].  
2. **Markings**: Look for stamps like "J.I. Case" or patent numbers (e.g., Jethro Wood’s 1819 patent[11]).  
3. **Blade shape**: Moldboards transitioned from flat (1700s) to twisted designs (late 1800s)[2][9].  
4. **Community resources**: Forums like Yesterday’s Tractors provide crowdsourced insights[6][12].

## 6. **Market Trends (2025)**  
- **Demand**: Niche interest persists, with rare sulky plows selling for $5,000–$20,000[7][10].  
- **Pricing tiers**:  
  - Common walking plows: $100–$300  
  - Horse-drawn models: $200–$500  
  - Restored tractor-pulled plows: $300–$700[10]  
- **Online platforms**: eBay and 1stDibs dominate sales, though local auctions yield hidden gems[7][12].  

---

## 7. **Acquisition and Sales Channels**  
- **Auctions**: Specialized farm equipment auctions (e.g., LiveAuctioneers[4])  
- **Dealers**: Antique stores in rural regions (e.g., Mid-Missouri Antique Power Assn.[11])  
- **Restoration networks**: Clubs like CRAFTS and Early American Industries Association[16]  

---

## 8. **Preservation Best Practices**  
- **Cleaning**: Remove soil with soft brushes; avoid abrasive tools to preserve patina[8][13].  
- **Rust prevention**: Apply linseed oil or John Deere Soft Black Coating to metal surfaces[8].  
- **Storage**: Keep in dry, climate-controlled spaces to prevent wood warping[9][13].
