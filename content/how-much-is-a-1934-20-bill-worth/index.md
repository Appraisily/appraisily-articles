Okay, I need to write a comprehensive article about the value of a 1934 $20 bill. Let me start by understanding the user's query. They want detailed information covering eight specific aspects, from historical background to preservation tips. 

First, I'll check the search results provided. There are 14 sources, mostly from coin dealers, currency valuation sites, and historical documents. The key points from the sources mention different series (1934, 1934A-D, Hawaii notes), factors like star notes and condition, and historical context like the shift from gold to silver standards and the Hawaii overprints during WWII.

The user wants the article structured into sections with headings. Let me map each of their eight points to sections. 

1. **Introduction/Overview**: Explain what a 1934 $20 bill is and why it's valuable. Sources [1], [2], [5], [6] discuss the historical significance, design changes, and rarity factors like Hawaii notes and star notes.

2. **Historical Background**: The transition from gold to silver, design changes in 1928, and the 1934 series context. Sources [1], [8], [11] touch on the economic history and design evolution.

3. **Types/Variations**: Different series (1934, A-D), Hawaii notes, star notes. Sources [1], [3], [4], [6], [13] detail the various series and their distinctions.

4. **Value Determinants**: Condition, star notes, series, Hawaii overprint. Sources [1], [3], [4], [6], [9] provide valuation guides based on these factors.

5. **Authentication**: Raised printing, UV checks, signatures. Source [7] offers a PDF on authenticating older notes, mentioning raised printing and signature checks. Also, source [10] and [12] discuss preservation but might relate to handling for authentication.

6. **Market Trends**: Current prices, auction results. Sources [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [9] give specific values for different grades and series.

7. **Buying/Selling**: Where to find these bills, trusted dealers. Sources [3], [4], [5], [6], [13] mention dealers like Golden Eagle Coins and JM Bullion, and auction houses.

8. **Preservation Tips**: Storage, handling, avoiding damage. Sources [10], [12], [14] provide tips on acid-free holders, humidity control, and gloves.

I need to ensure each section is comprehensive, cites the relevant sources, and flows naturally. For example, in the historical section, mention the shift from gold to silver in 1934, the Hawaii notes due to WWII fears, and the design elements. In valuation, detail each series and how condition affects price, using specific examples from the sources. 

I should also watch out for contradictions. For instance, some sources say circulated 1934D bills are close to face value [3], while others note star notes or Hawaii versions are more valuable [1], [13]. Highlighting these nuances will add depth.

Authentication steps from source [7] include checking raised printing, UV light, and signatures. I'll need to explain each step clearly, maybe mentioning how counterfeit detection works.

Market trends should reference recent auction prices, like the 1934B star note sold for £3,290 in 2016 [1], and the current stock listings from Golden Eagle Coins [2], [5], [6].

Preservation tips from sources [10], [12], [14] emphasize acid-free holders, gloves, and controlled environments. It's important to stress proper storage to maintain value.

I need to structure all this into the mandated report format with headers, avoiding lists, using paragraphs, and inline citations. Make sure each section has subsections where necessary, like under types breaking down each series and Hawaii notes. 

Also, ensure that all citations are correctly numbered based on the provided search results. For example, when discussing Hawaii notes, cite [1], [13]. When talking about star notes, cite [1], [3], [4].

Finally, the conclusion should synthesize the key points, reiterating the factors that influence value and the importance of preservation. Avoid introducing new information here.

I need to start drafting each section, ensuring that each paragraph flows into the next, covers all necessary points, and adheres to the formatting rules. Check for any missing information or areas that need more detail based on the sources. Make sure the language is formal and academic, yet accessible, avoiding bullet points and using full paragraphs with citations as needed.

# The Comprehensive Guide to the Value of 1934 $20 Bills  

The 1934 $20 bill represents a critical juncture in U.S. monetary history, reflecting economic reforms during the Great Depression and evolving security features. While most circulated examples trade near face value, certain series, conditions, and rare variants—such as star notes, Hawaii overprints, and printing errors—can command premiums exceeding $750[1][3][6]. This guide explores the historical context, design variations, authentication methods, and preservation strategies essential for collectors and historians seeking to appraise these notes accurately.

## Historical Context and Development of the 1934 $20 Bill  

### Transition from Gold to Silver Standards  
The 1934 $20 bill emerged during a period of profound economic transformation. Following the abandonment of the gold standard in 1933, the U.S. shifted to a silver-backed currency system, enabling redemption of bills for silver until 1963[1][8]. This policy shift aimed to stabilize the economy during the Great Depression, as over half of elderly Americans lacked sufficient income for self-support[11]. The 1934 series thus symbolizes the federal government’s efforts to restore public confidence through monetary reform.  

### Design Evolution and Andrew Jackson’s Controversial Portrait  
The 1934 $20 bill retained the portrait of Andrew Jackson, first introduced in 1928. Jackson’s inclusion sparked debate due to his opposition to centralized banking, yet the Treasury defended the choice as a recognition of his populist legacy[1][5]. The bill’s dimensions (156 x 66 mm) matched modern notes but were significantly smaller than pre-1928 "Demand Notes"[1]. The reverse featured an engraving of the White House, devoid of the "In God We Trust" motto added in the 1950s[1][6].  

### Wartime Measures: The Hawaii Overprint  
In 1942, following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. issued 1934 and 1934A series bills overprinted with "HAWAII" in brown ink. These notes, designed to be declared worthless if Hawaii fell to invasion, are now highly collectible, with circulated examples valued at $125–$300[1][13]. Approximately 11 million $20 Hawaii notes were printed, though many were recalled post-WWII[13].

## Variations and Classifications of 1934 $20 Bills  

### Series Distinctions (1934, 1934A–D)  
The 1934 series includes five primary subtypes, differentiated by Treasury signatures and minor design adjustments:  
- **1934**: Signed by Julian and Morgenthau Jr. (VF condition: ~$30)[1].  
- **1934A**: Julian and Morgenthau Jr.; star notes in VF: ~$75[1][4].  
- **1934B**: Julian and Vinson; star notes graded 63 EPQ sold for £3,290 in 2016[1].  
- **1934C**: Julian and Snyder; uncirculated star notes: ~$450[1].  
- **1934D**: Clark and Snyder; "Wide Back" variants with distinct reverse designs[6].  

### Star Notes and Replacement Bills  
Star notes, marked by a ★ in the serial number, were replacements for damaged bills during printing. These are rarer and command significant premiums. For example, a 1934D star note in uncirculated condition (grade 63) may fetch $750, compared to $75 for a non-star equivalent[1][3].  

### Mule Errors and Printing Anomalies  
The 1934D "Mule" error, caused by mismatched obverse and reverse printing plates, is among the rarest variants, with fewer than 100 surviving examples[2][6]. Such errors elevate values dramatically, with auction prices exceeding $3,000 for high-grade specimens[2].

## Factors Influencing Value and Appraisal  

### Condition Grading Standards  
- **Circulated (VF–XF)**: Light folds, sharp details ($25–$50 for non-star 1934)[1][3].  
- **Uncirculated (63–70)**: No handling marks, crisp paper ($75–$750 for star notes)[1][6].  
- **Hawaii Notes**: Brown seals and overprints increase value 6–15x face value[1][13].  

### Rarity and Historical Significance  
The 1934A Hawaii note’s wartime provenance and limited survival rate make it a centerpiece for collectors. Similarly, star notes from smaller Federal Reserve districts (e.g., Minneapolis) are scarcer due to lower print runs[9].  

### Market Demand and Auction Trends  
Recent sales highlight the premium for exceptional specimens:  
- A 1934B star note graded 65 EPQ realized £3,290 ($4,200) in 2016[1].  
- Uncirculated 1934D "Wide Back" notes trade for $300–$500[6].  
- Hawaii notes in AU condition: $600–$1,200[13].

## Authentication and Fraud Detection  

### Key Security Features  
1. **Raised Printing**: Tactile texture on portraits and numerals[7].  
2. **UV Fluorescence**: Genuine notes absorb UV light; counterfeit bills often glow[7].  
3. **Signature Verification**: Match Treasurer/Secretary pairs to historical records (e.g., 1934D: Clark/Snyder)[3][7].  

### Common Counterfeit Indicators  
- Blurred lines or broken points in engraving[7].  
- Incorrect paper composition (75% linen, 25% cotton)[1].  
- Mismatched serial numbers or district seals[7].

## Acquisition and Market Channels  

### Trusted Dealers and Auction Houses  
- **JM Bullion**: Specializes in Hawaii notes and star variants[13].  
- **Golden Eagle Coins**: Offers graded examples, including Mule errors[2][5].  
- **Heritage Auctions**: Primary venue for high-value sales (e.g., $3,290 1934B star note)[1].  

### Online Platforms and Collector Networks  
- **eBay**: Circulated notes near face value; uncirculated specimens require third-party grading[3][4].  
- **Professional Associations**: The American Numismatic Association (ANA) provides dealer directories[9].  

---

## Preservation Best Practices  

### Storage and Handling Protocols  
- **Acid-Free Holders**: Mylar or polyethylene sleeves prevent chemical degradation[10][12].  
- **Climate Control**: Maintain 45–55% humidity and <24°C (75°F) to avoid brittleness[12][14].  
- **Handling**: Use cotton gloves to minimize oil transfer[10][14].  

### Restoration and Conservation  
- Avoid DIY repairs; consult archival experts for damaged notes[10].  
- UV-blocking display cases mitigate fading[12].

## Conclusion  

The 1934 $20 bill’s value hinges on a confluence of historical context, physical condition, and rarity. While most circulated examples remain near face value, star notes, Hawaii overprints, and printing errors exemplify the premiums achievable in numismatics. Collectors must prioritize authentication and preservation to safeguard these artifacts of U.S. economic history. As market demand for Depression-era currency grows, understanding these nuances becomes indispensable for informed acquisition and appraisal.
