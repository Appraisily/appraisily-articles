Okay, I need to write a comprehensive article on the value of antique fire extinguisher grenades. Let me start by understanding what exactly the user is asking for. They want detailed information covering eight specific aspects: definition and importance, historical background, types, factors affecting value, authentication, market trends, buying/selling sources, and care tips.

First, I'll review the provided search results to gather relevant information. The search results include various sources discussing the history, types, manufacturers, and values of fire grenades. For example, sources [1], [2], [5], [6], [8], [10], and [12] mention different aspects like their historical use, materials, and current collectible value. 

Starting with the first section: defining what an antique fire extinguisher grenade is and why it's valuable. From the sources, I know these were glass orbs filled with substances like salt water or carbon tetrachloride, used in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Their value today comes from historical significance, rarity, and aesthetic appeal. Sources [5] and [6] discuss their collectibility and prices ranging from $25 to over $2000.

Next, the historical background. Sources [4], [5], [8], and [12] mention their invention in the 19th century, patents, and evolution from salt water to carbon tetrachloride. Captain George Manby's early extinguisher design is noted in [4] and [7]. The shift to CTC and its later ban due to toxicity is covered in [8] and [10].

For types and variations, sources [5], [6], [8], and [12] list manufacturers like Red Comet, Harden Star, and Shur-Stop. Different shapes (gourd, teardrop) and colors (red, cobalt blue) are mentioned. Some were wall-mounted, others in wire baskets. The materials include glass with enameled finishes [1], [3], [10].

Factors affecting value include condition, rarity, manufacturer, and presence of original contents. Sources [5], [6], [10] note that intact labels, unique designs, and sealed grenades (though hazardous) increase value. Reproductions are a concern, with thicker glass and different seams as indicators [5], [12].

Authentication involves checking for manufacturer marks, glass quality, and provenance. Sources [5], [6], [12] suggest looking for embossed logos, applied necks, and original brackets. Reproductions might have modern markings or incorrect materials.

Market trends: eBay and antique shops are common venues. Prices vary; [5] mentions $25 to $2000, with rare examples higher. Recent trends from [5] note stagnant prices but high demand for rare pieces. Auctions and online platforms are key sources [5], [6], [10].

Buying/selling sources include auctions, antique stores, online marketplaces, and bottle shows. Safety is a concern with CTC-filled grenades, as noted in [2], [9], [10], [13]. Proper handling and storage are emphasized.

Care tips: Avoid breaking, store safely, handle with care. Sources [9], [13] advise against opening sealed grenades and recommend professional disposal if damaged. Display mounts and avoiding direct sunlight are suggested.

I need to structure all this into sections with headers, ensuring each part flows into the next. Use citations from the search results appropriately. Make sure to cover each of the user's eight points thoroughly, using examples and data from the sources. Avoid lists, use paragraphs, and maintain an academic tone. Check that all claims are backed by the provided search results and cite them correctly. Also, remember the current date is 2025, so any time references should be consistent with that.

## Historical Evolution of Fire Extinguisher Grenades  

### Early Innovations and 19th-Century Adoption  
The concept of fire grenades dates to ancient Rome, but their modern iteration emerged during the American Civil War. The first patent for a glass fire grenade was granted in 1863, with widespread adoption beginning in the 1870s[5][8]. Early models contained saltwater or ammonium chloride solutions, chosen for their low freezing points[8][12]. These grenades were marketed as affordable, decorative solutions for domestic fire safety, often mounted on walls in wire brackets or displayed in ornamental metal cradles[1][5].  

By the late 19th century, manufacturers like Harden’s Star, Red Comet, and AutoFyrStop dominated the market, producing grenades in vibrant colors such as cobalt blue, ruby red, and amber[1][6][12]. The shift to carbon tetrachloride (CTC) in the early 1900s improved fire suppression efficacy but introduced significant health risks, as CTC decomposes into phosgene gas—a lethal chemical weapon—when exposed to heat[8][10]. Despite their toxicity, CTC-filled grenades remained popular until the mid-20th century, when regulatory bans and safer alternatives rendered them obsolete[8][13].  

### Technological Shifts and Decline  
The advent of pressurized metal extinguishers, pioneered by Captain George Manby in 1818, gradually supplanted glass grenades[4][7]. By the 1930s, fire grenades were relegated to niche use, though their industrial design and colorful aesthetics ensured their survival as collectibles[5][12].

## Typology and Variations  

### Design and Manufacturing Diversity  
Antique fire extinguisher grenades exhibit remarkable diversity in form and function:  
- **Shapes**: Common designs included bulbous orbs, teardrops, and rolling pins, with sizes ranging from 4 to 8 inches in diameter[1][5][12].  
- **Materials**: Most were hand-blown glass, though later models featured machine-made frosted or clear glass. Enameled finishes, as seen in Shur-Stop grenades, added decorative flair[1][6].  
- **Mounting Systems**: Wall-mounted brackets with heat-sensitive metal hooks were standard, designed to release grenades automatically during fires[1][4].  

### Notable Manufacturers and Brands  
- **Harden’s Star**: Known for cobalt blue grenades embossed with a five-pointed star, these are among the most coveted by collectors[5][12].  
- **Red Comet**: Recognizable by their ruby-red enameled glass, these grenades often command premium prices[1][6].  
- **AutoFyrStop**: Philadelphia-based models featured frosted glass and intricate labels, blending functionality with Victorian ornamentation[5][12].

## Valuation Factors  

### Rarity and Condition  
Intact grenades with original labels, brackets, and seals are exceptionally rare, as most were destroyed during use. A sealed Harden’s Star grenade in cobalt blue recently sold for $2,000, while common Red Comet models typically fetch $75–$150[5][6][10]. Damage—such as cracks, scratches, or enamel loss—can reduce value by 50% or more[6][12].  

### Historical Provenance  
Grenades salvaged from historic sites, such as early 20th-century mansions or factories, often carry provenance premiums. For example, a lot of three Shur-Stop grenades recovered from a 1929 Highland Park estate sold for $1,800 in 2024[1][5].  

### Chemical Contents  
While sealed grenades filled with CTC are hazardous, they are prized by collectors for their authenticity. A 1905 CTC-filled example from Paris’s L’Incustomable brand sold for $1,200 in 2023, despite requiring hazmat handling[10][13].
