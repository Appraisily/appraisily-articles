How can I identify a genuine Whiting & Davis purse?**\n\n**Answer:** Identifying a genuine Whiting & Davis purse involves careful examination of several key features. Firstly, look for the signature mesh material. Whiting & Davis purses are typically made of intricately woven metal mesh, often resembling chainmail. The mesh should be supple and fluid, not stiff or rigid. Secondly, examine the lining. Original linings were often made of rayon or satin, and should be in reasonably good condition for the purse's age.\n\n*   **Logos and Markings:** Look for the Whiting & Davis logo. This might be stamped on the frame, lining, or a metal tag inside the purse. Common marks include \"Whiting & Davis Co.,\" \"Mesh Bags,\" or simply \"W&D.\" Be wary of purses lacking any markings, as this could indicate a reproduction.\n*   **Frame and Clasp:** The frame and clasp are also indicative of authenticity. Original Whiting & Davis purses often had intricate frames made of materials like sterling silver, gold plate, or enameled metal. The clasp should be secure and well-made, often featuring decorative elements.\n*   **Mesh Quality:** Inspect the mesh for uniformity and evenness. Any gaps or inconsistencies may suggest a poorly made reproduction.\n*   **Construction:** Genuine Whiting & Davis purses demonstrate high-quality construction. Seams should be neat and strong, and all components should fit together seamlessly.\n*   **Research:** Compare your purse to images of authenticated Whiting & Davis purses online or in reference books. This can help you identify any discrepancies.\n\n**2. What factors influence the value of a Whiting & Davis purse?**\n\n**Answer:** Several factors determine the value of a Whiting & Davis purse, including condition, rarity, design, materials, and provenance. Condition is paramount; purses in excellent condition, with minimal wear and tear, command higher prices. Damage like tarnishing, broken mesh, or frayed lining significantly reduces value.\n\n*   **Rarity:** Scarce or limited-edition designs are more valuable. Purses with unique color combinations, unusual mesh patterns, or special embellishments are highly sought after.\n*   **Design:** Certain designs, such as flapper-era purses with intricate Art Deco patterns or styles popular during specific periods, may be more desirable to collectors.\n*   **Materials:** Purses made with precious metals like sterling silver or gold plate are inherently more valuable than those made with base metals. Purses featuring enamel work, gemstones, or other decorative elements also tend to fetch higher prices.\n*   **Size:** Generally, larger purses tend to be worth more than smaller ones, especially if they are still in good condition.\n*   **Provenance:** If you have documentation proving the purse's history (e.g., original purchase receipts, family heirlooms), it can increase its value and appeal to collectors.\n\n**3. How can I determine the age of my Whiting & Davis purse?**\n\n**Answer:** Determining the age of your Whiting & Davis purse requires a combination of research and observation. The style, materials, and markings all provide clues. Whiting & Davis produced purses from the late 19th century through the late 20th century, with different styles dominating each era.\n\n*   **Logo Variations:** The Whiting & Davis logo evolved over time. Researching the different logo variations and their corresponding time periods can help narrow down the age of your purse.\n*   **Mesh Type:** The type of mesh used can also indicate age. Early purses often featured more delicate and intricate mesh patterns, while later purses may have simpler or more modern designs.\n*   **Lining Material:** The type of lining material can also be an indicator. Earlier purses used silk or velvet linings, while later purses used rayon or synthetic fabrics.\n*   **Frame and Clasp Style:** The style of the frame and clasp can also provide clues. Art Deco frames and clasps were popular in the 1920s and 1930s, while more streamlined designs emerged in later decades.\n*   **Online Resources:** Consult online resources like vintage purse guides, collector forums, and auction archives to compare your purse to known examples from different periods.\n\n**4. What are some common problems with Whiting & Davis purses that affect their value?**\n\n**Answer:** Several common problems can negatively impact the value of Whiting & Davis purses. Identifying these issues is crucial for an accurate assessment.\n\n*   **Tarnishing:** Metal mesh is prone to tarnishing, especially if exposed to moisture or air. Heavy tarnishing can significantly detract from a purse's appearance and value.\n*   **Broken or Missing Mesh:** The delicate mesh is susceptible to damage. Broken or missing mesh links are a common problem that requires professional repair. Even small areas of damage can decrease the value.\n*   **Lining Damage:** The lining can become torn, stained, or faded over time. Significant lining damage reduces the overall appeal and value.\n*   **Frame Damage:** Dents, scratches, or broken clasps on the frame can also lower the value.\n*   **Missing Stones or Embellishments:** If the purse features gemstones, enamel work, or other embellishments, missing pieces can detract from its value.\n*   **Repair Quality:** Poorly executed repairs can be worse than no repair at all. Amateur repairs can damage the mesh or frame and lower the overall value.\n\n**5. Where can I sell my Whiting & Davis purse for the best price?**\n\n**Answer:** Selling your Whiting & Davis purse for the best price requires careful consideration of different selling venues, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\n*   **Online Auction Sites (eBay):** eBay offers a wide audience and competitive bidding, potentially leading to a higher selling price. However, you'll need good photos, accurate descriptions, and be prepared to handle shipping and returns.\n*   **Online Consignment Shops (The RealReal, ThredUp):** These sites handle the selling process for you, but they take a commission. They are a good option if you don't want to deal with listing and shipping yourself. Be sure to check their consignment rates beforehand.\n*   **Antique Dealers:** Local antique dealers specializing in vintage accessories can offer a fair price if they are interested in your purse. They usually offer a lower price than what you could get selling directly to a collector, but the transaction is quick and easy.\n*   **Vintage Clothing Stores:** Some vintage clothing stores also buy vintage accessories. Similar to antique dealers, they may offer a lower price but provide a convenient selling option.\n*   **Specialized Purse Auctions:** Auctions specializing in vintage purses and accessories often attract serious collectors willing to pay top dollar. This is the best option for rare or high-value purses.\n*   **Collector Forums:** Online forums dedicated to vintage purse collectors can be a good place to find potential buyers.\n\n**6. How should I care for my Whiting & Davis purse to maintain its value?**\n\n**Answer:** Proper care is essential to preserve the value and beauty of your Whiting & Davis purse. Preventative measures and gentle cleaning are key.\n\n*   **Storage:** Store your purse in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and humidity. Use a dust bag or acid-free tissue paper to protect it from scratches and dust. Avoid storing it in plastic bags, as this can trap moisture.\n*   **Cleaning:** Clean your purse regularly with a soft, dry cloth to remove dust and dirt. For tarnished metal, use a specialized silver or metal cleaner designed for delicate items. Test the cleaner on an inconspicuous area first.\n*   **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Never use harsh chemicals, abrasives, or solvents to clean your purse. These can damage the mesh, lining, and frame.\n*   **Handle with Care:** Avoid overfilling your purse, as this can strain the mesh and frame. Handle the purse gently to prevent damage.\n*   **Professional Cleaning:** For heavily soiled or tarnished purses, consider professional cleaning by a reputable antique restorer or purse specialist.\n\n**7.
