Okay, I need to figure out how to determine the value of a Whiting and Davis purse. Let me start by understanding what these purses are. From the search results, Whiting and Davis is a company that started in the late 1800s, known for their metal mesh purses. They were popular in the 1920s with flappers and have had various collaborations with designers like Elsa Schiaparelli. 

First, the user wants to know what "how much is my Whiting and Davis purse worth" entails. That's about appraising the purse's value based on factors like age, condition, rarity, and design. It's important because vintage fashion items can be collectible and have significant resale value.

Next, historical background. The company was founded in 1896, started making mesh purses in 1892. They automated production in 1912, which made them more prolific. They had different eras, like Art Deco designs in the 1920s, collaborations in the 1930s, and a resurgence in the 1970s disco era. This history affects the purse's value depending on the era it's from.

Types and variations: The search results mention different types like Dresden mesh, armor mesh, enameled clasps, and collaborations. There are also different styles like clutches, shoulder bags, and coin purses. Each type might have different values. For example, Art Deco designs from the 1920s might be more valuable than later models.

Factors determining value: Condition is crucial. The search results mention checking for tarnish, missing links, enamel wear, and functioning clasps. Authenticity markers like hallmarks, logos, and craftsmanship details are important. Rarity plays a role too—limited editions or designer collaborations (like with Schiaparelli) could be more valuable. Provenance, like being owned by a celebrity, might increase value.

Identifying authentic pieces: Look for the Whiting and Davis logo, which is often stamped on the frame. The quality of the mesh—handmade vs. machine-made—can indicate age. Materials matter; earlier purses used precious metals, while later ones might use plated metals. The lining (silk vs. synthetic) and construction details (like soldered links) help authenticate.

Market trends: Prices on sites like 1stDibs and Poshmark range from $20 to over $600. Auction results show some purses selling for around $50 to $300, with rare pieces higher. The disco-era pieces from the 70s are trendy now. Celebrity ownership, like Paris Hilton or Lady Gaga, might drive up prices.

Where to buy/sell: Online marketplaces (1stDibs, Poshmark, Etsy), auction houses (LiveAuctioneers), vintage stores, and antique shops. Specialized dealers might offer better prices for rare items.

Care tips: Avoid moisture, store in cool, dry places, clean with a soft cloth, don't overload to prevent stretching. Professional restoration services are recommended for repairs.

I need to structure all this into sections with headings, include examples from the search results, and cite sources properly. Make sure each section flows into the next, using paragraphs without lists. Check that all factors are covered and use specific data points from the search results, like price ranges and historical dates. Also, mention case studies like specific auctions or designer collaborations. Ensure citations are correctly formatted with the source numbers provided.

## Historical Context and Evolution of Whiting & Davis Purses  

### Origins and Early Innovations (1892–1910s)  
Charles Whiting pioneered the first handcrafted mesh purse in 1892 while working at Wade Davis & Company, creating three-inch-square coin purses using medieval chainmail techniques[3][12]. These early pieces, often made from precious metals like sterling silver, were labor-intensive, with artisans hand-linking up to 1,000 rings daily[12]. In 1896, Whiting partnered with Edward P. Davis to form the Whiting & Davis Manufacturing Company, establishing a legacy of innovation[1][3]. The 1912 introduction of automated mesh production revolutionized scalability, enabling mass production while retaining artisanal quality[1][7].  

### Golden Age: Art Deco and Designer Collaborations (1920s–1930s)  
The 1920s flapper era cemented Whiting & Davis’ status as a luxury brand. Dresden mesh purses, featuring silkscreened Impressionist motifs, and Art Deco geometric designs became icons of Jazz Age glamour[7][8]. Collaborations with designers like Paul Poiret and Elsa Schiaparelli in the 1930s introduced avant-garde shapes and enameled clasps, with Schiaparelli’s surrealist-inspired designs remaining highly collectible[7][12].  

### Mid-Century Adaptations and Resurgence (1940s–2000s)  
During WWII, the company shifted to radar equipment production, resuming purse manufacturing post-war with expanded lines, including clothing[1]. The 1970s disco revival saw metallic mesh bags paired with Halston-era fashion, while 2000s celebrity endorsements (e.g., Paris Hilton, Lady Gaga) reignited interest in vintage designs[1][7].
