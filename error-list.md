## Site Header/Navigation Issues

After building the site, I checked the navigation header. The current issue is that:

1. In the homepage (`/`), the navigation menu shows "About, Services, Expertise, Team" links from the main site
2. In the article pages (e.g., `/articles/elgin-antique-pocket-watch-value/`), the navigation correctly shows "Home, Articles, Main Site"

The inconsistency appears to be coming from the menu structure defined in `config.toml` and how it's being pulled into the `header.html` template. The header.html file was updated to use direct links for "Home, Articles, Main Site" but the homepage might be overriding this with menu items from config.toml.

## Recommendation

1. Fix the `div` tag issue in the fine-art-appraisals.md file
2. Modify the `header.html` template to ensure consistent navigation between homepage and article pages by replacing the menu range with fixed links
3. Update the config.toml to ensure menu items align with the desired navigation structure

Overall, the regenerated articles look very good with proper image implementation as per the new guidelines. The only real issue is the inconsistent navigation between homepage and article pages.
