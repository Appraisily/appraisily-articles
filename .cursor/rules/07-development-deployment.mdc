# Development and Deployment Guide

This guide covers development workflow, scripts, and deployment process.

## Development Environment

Required tools:
- Hugo v0.121.1+
- Node.js
- NPM

## Key Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local development server
npm run dev

# Generate a new article
npm run generate -- "topic-or-keyword"

# Generate all pending articles
npm run generate:all

# Build the site for production
npm run build:simple
```

## Development Workflow

1. Set up local environment by installing dependencies
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
3. Create new articles with AI generation or manual editing
4. Test all changes locally before committing
5. Use shortcode validation with `npm run validate`

## Deployment

The site is deployed on Netlify with continuous deployment from the main branch:

- Configuration: [netlify.toml](mdc:netlify.toml)
- Build command: `npm run build:simple`
- No API keys needed in Netlify environment

## Security Guidelines

- Never commit API keys to the repository
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local development
- Use pre-commit hook to catch sensitive information: `cp pre-commit-hook .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
